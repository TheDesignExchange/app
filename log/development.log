Reflective Critique\nThe principle of reflective critique ensures people reflect on issues and processes and make explicit the interpretations, biases, assumptions and concerns upon which judgments are made.  In this way, practical accounts can give rise to theoretical considerations.\n\n2. Dialectical critique\nDialectical critique is required to understand the set of relationships both between the phenomenon and its context, and between the elements constituting the phenomenon.  The key elements to focus attention on are those constituent elements that are unstable, or in opposition to one another.  These are the ones that are most likely to create changes.\n\n3. Collaborative Resource \nThe principle of collaborative resource presupposes that each person’s ideas are equally significant as potential resources for creating interpretive categories of analysis, negotiated among the participants.  It strives to avoid the skewing of credibility stemming from the prior status of an idea-holder.  It especially makes possible the insights gleaned from noting the contradictions both between many viewpoints and within a single viewpoint\n\n4. Risk\nInitiators of action research will use this principle to allay others’ fears and invite participation by pointing out that they, too, will be subject to the same process, and that whatever the outcome, learning will take place.\n\n5.Plural Structure\nThis plural structure of inquiry requires a plural text for reporting.  This means that there will be many accounts made explicit, with commentaries on their contradictions, and a range of options for action presented.\n\n6. Theory, Practice, Transformation\nFor action researchers, theory informs practice, practice refines theory, in a continuous transformation."], ["process", "Action Research Procedure is a cycle of five stages:\n1. Diagnosing: Identifying or defining a problem\n2. Action Planning: Consider alternative courses of action\n3. Taking Action: Selecting a course of action\n4.

We listen to what is going on within ourselves, as well as to what is taking place in the person we are hearing. We listen to the words of the other, but we also listen to the messages buried in the words. We listen to the voice, the appearance, and the body language of the other...

The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated, the greater the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.\n2. Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.\n3. Welcome unusual ideas: To get a good and long list of ideas, unusual ideas are welcomed. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking may provide better solutions.\n4.

The focus is largely on the acceptability of a product rather than the relationship between the user and the product. Ethnography provides a higher chance for the designer to incorporate users' desires.\n\nBlomberg emphasizes guiding principles when applying ethnography to design research so as to maintain the method's authenticity:\nNatural Settings: Research and observations must be conducted in field settings rather than in laboratories\nHolism: Behaviors must be understood in everyday contexts, how they fit into larger society\nDescriptive: Descriptive understanding derives from how people actually behave versus how they ought to; non-judgmental\nMembers' Point of View: Must situate oneself in point of view of the observed\n\nFirst applied to product design in the 1980s when traditional view that technologies supported individual tasks shifted to view that technologies should assist collaboration and cooperation among people. (Blomberg) New field developed: Computer Support for Cooperative Work (also, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) (CSCW) to design computer software and tooks for group work. Anthropologists, using ethnographic processes, examined everyday practices of computer users. Found large discrepancy between software programmer's intuition for how intended users would use programs and how consumers actually used them.

The ability to explain a topic in written form requires a sufficient understanding of the topic alone. \n\nDandelion is an extension from Wiki.

A log that keeps information on which users input information adds to the sense of responsibility and accountability.\n\nDeficits of this method:\n- Conflicting opinions between coordinators and design participants as the Dandelion was used\n- Disclosing unfinished products\n- Reminder feature\n-Due to the nature of collaborative sharing, information needs to be consistently checked for validity\n\nThis method drives the flow of collaboration and provides collaboration awareness."], ["process", "To edit a wiki's node, click on the 'Edit page' and input relevant information."], ["updated_at", Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:19:50 UTC +00:00]]

Whenever an ethnographer discovers contrasts among the members of a domain, these contrasts are best thought of as attributes or components of meaning.\n\nThe purpose of Componential Analysis is to organize and represent contrasts discovered through ethnographies and taxonomies.\n\nThis method of organizing information should be used with ethnographic research, specifically with the methods of Participant Observation and Taxonomies"], ["owner_id", 2], ["principle", "Related Methods: Classic Ethnography, Rapid Ethnography, Quick and Dirty Ethnography, Participant Observation, Taxonomies\n\nComponential Analysis has been most frequently used to breakdown the meanings of somewhat related words with particular emphasis placed on kinship analysis words (eg: brother, mother, aunt) and their translation between languages. For example, one could compare the terms sister and brother and find that these terms are parallel in the sense that both are children of the same parent but will find that the words differ in gender identified.\n\nJames P. Spradley was on the forefront of using this term for ethnographic purposes when he published his book \"Participant Observation\" in 1980."], ["process", "1. Select a domain for analysis\n2.

Prepare a paradigm worksheet - consists of an empty paradigm in which you enter the cultural categories of the domain down the lefthand column, while making notes about the relationships between the paradigm and the other domains.\n4. Identify dimensions of contrast that have binary values - A dimension of contrast is an idea or concept that has at least two parts, although in this case it specifically has two parts since the values must be binary. (e.g. If you were analyzing the domain \"kinds of trees,\" you would come up with one dimension of contrast that might be stated \"characterized by the presence of leaves.\" This is a dimension of contrast related to trees and has two values or parts: \"yes\" or \"no.\")\n5. Combine closely related dimensions of contrast into ones that have multipe values - Instead of \"yes\" or \"no\" dimensions of contrast, add more complex ones such as \"First language,\" providing more qualitative information.\n6.

Contextual Inquiry: One-on-one interaction with people in the work place, while they work. Team interpretation sessions, where each member of the team puts their own perspective to bear on the data. This produces a shared understanding of the customer.\n2. Work Modeling: Work models are created during the interpretation sessions introduced above. These work models take one of five forms, and allow a concrete, visual representation of the work that each interviewed customer engages in.\n3. Consolidation: In this stage the team finds the common structure of the customers' work, bringing the many details together to produce a cohesive pattern. A single picture of the population is made explicit. This part of the CD process uses two tools: affinity diagrams and work models. Affinity diagrams illustrate each detail from each interviewed customer's experience, while work models integrate these details into an overarching picture. This picture then guides the design team in their task.\n4. Work Redesign: Work Redesign focuses on the ways that the customers' work experience can be improved-- before any new technology or system is put in place. It takes the vision developed from the Consolidation stage and uses it as a base for any brainstorms of new technologies. Storyboards of how the experience would be different are helpful in this stage.\n5. User Environment Design: User Environment Design makes the new system--and the new way of working that this implies--explicit. In this step each part of the new system is tied to the customer's work model, including \"how it supports the user's work, exactly what function is available in that part, and how it connects with other parts of the system\" (Beyer & Holtzblatt 24). This step justifies the new system's many parts, without having to commit and without involving a user interface. With each part of the step made explicit, the team can ensure that the many parts relate to one another and meet the customers' needs. It ensures coherence in the design process, keeping the system focused on the customer data.\n6. Mock-Up & Test with Customers: Any system needs to be tested and tweaked before being finalized. This part of the process uses paper prototypes to introduce the initial concept of the design to the customer. This prototyping session with the customer enables the design team to work with the customers and individualize the system to meet their needs. Partnering with the client then spurs a detailed user interface and improved system.\n7. Putting into Practice: Implement! The last step is to tailor your design system to the workplace itself."], ["updated_at", Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:19:50 UTC +00:00]]

For users it may be difficult to provide an early, low-fidelity improvisation prototype of sufficiently robust nature that they can have an experience in a naturalistic context without supervision. At higher levels of fidelity, clients may become attached to early ideas when they experience a single convincing manifestation of many different possibilities and perceive it as the final solution.\n\nRelated Methods: Story boards, mock ups, Role Playing, SPES"], ["process", "Having said that, there are three general situations in which Experience Prototyping is especially useful:\n1. Understanding existing user experiences and context - This can be done by replicating a circumstance that a consumer could face, which is similar to an Autoethnography since the designer notes his or her personal experience.\n2. Exploring and Evaluating Design Ideas - The main purpose of this is to facilitate the exploration of possible solutions and directing the design team towards a more informed development of the user expereince and the tangible components that create it. In this process, designers often use crude props to simulate experiences, reenact social situations, or simply observe people using prototypes in natural settings.\n3. Communicating Ideas - The role of experience prototyping in this last category is to let a client, a design colleague, or a user understand the subjective value of a design idea by directly experiencing it in an effort to persuade the target audience of the design's value."], ["updated_at", Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:19:52 UTC +00:00]]

They are normally one-off sessions although several may be run simultaneously in different locations. \nA facilitator leads a guided discussion of 6-12 people on a specific topic. A typical focus group normally lasts one or two hours and is normally recorded and a report is produced of the process and results. This is then distributed to all the participants. The focus group may be watched by the client or other interested parties. \n\nFocus groups provide useful information on how people respond to particular questions or issues, but the short amount of time limits the depth of discussion that can be had.\n\nThere are 2 possible times to conduct focus groups:\n1. In the beginning during strategic research – when researching what the target market wants, focus groups are usually done after quantitative studies such as surveys, in order to explore statistics in greater depth.\n2. At the end after the creative executions are done, finding out how the target market perceives the finished product so that adjustments can be made before the product is released to the public.\n\nThis method is often used as a complementary tool to interviews and observation."], ["owner_id", 2], ["principle", "The 10 S's: \n1. Synergy – the group process generates a wider range of information than would accrue from a comparable number of depth interviews.\n2. Snowballing – respondent interaction creating a chain of thought and ideas.\n3. Serendipity – a great idea can drop out of the blue.\n4. Stimulation – respondent’s views are brought out by the group process.\n5. Security – respondents are more likely to be candid as there will probably be other similar people there, and there is less individual pressure than in a depth interview.\n6. Spontaneity – because no one individual is required to respond to a question, this encourages a spontaneous response when people have a definite point of view.\n7. Specialization – a trained moderator can interview more respondents in a given 7. session.\n8. Structure – it is easier for the moderator to reintroduce a topic not adequately covered before than in a depth interview.\n9. Speed – quicker than individual interviews.\n10. Scrutiny – can be observed by members of the research team.\n\nThe term was first coined by psychologist and marketing expert Ernest Dichter. Focus groups have expanded in development greatly after 1987. Since then, they have been found useful in Sociology, Psychology, Social Science, Health etc. The scope of Focus group applications is far reaching, and development in all fields is continuing to grow.\n\nBenefits of Method:\n1. A focus group produces data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction that can be found in a group setting. Participants can inspire each other and cause them to remember or share things that would not have come out through a one-on-one interview.\n2. Extrinsic issues of process (e.g. quicker, cheaper, observable by clients, easier to analyze)\n\nDeficits of Method: \n1. Qualitative data is harder to analyze\n2. Costly to hold focus groups\n3. The success often hinges on having a good moderator\n4. Unable to match the depth and detail generated by individual interviews and to uncover subtleties in attitudes. Deeper attitudinal data was felt to be closed off in the focus groups, yet was accessible in the individual depth interviews.\n\nRelated Methods: Unfocus Groups, Interviews, Direct Observation, Conjoint Techniques"], ["process", "There are several Key Characteristics of a Successful Focus Group: \n1. Carefully select and prepare participants\n2. Prepare well for the meeting\n3. Create a democratic, supportive and informal atmosphere\n3. Skillfully moderate the discussion\n4. Pay attention to the individual needs of different consumers\n5. 6-8 participants is an optimal number; however, sometimes larger numbers of participants representing differing viewpoints can raise important issues\n6. May be desirable to include critical users representing the extremes of the user group to ensure inclusive design"], ["updated_at", Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:19:52 UTC +00:00]]

In Porto Alegre, Brazil (the city with the longest running participatory budgeting process) there has been a significant reallocation of resources towards spending in poorer areas as well as increased efficiency and reduced corruption as a result of participatory budgeting.\n\nDeficit of the method: \n• Can create unrealistic expectations amongst participants if managed badly.\n• Works best where there are high levels of community activism to begin with.\n• Doesn't work well where central targets and restricted budgets limit the amount of power that can be given to citizens.\n• In most processes meetings are open to all, creating the risk of certain groups dominating the proceedings. However, research into participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre shows that the poorest neighbourhoods have actually been the more active participants. This can probably be linked to the fact that poorer neighbourhoods feel a more pressing need for improved services."], ["process", "The 'classic' participatory budgeting model as developed in Brazil makes use of area meetings where all citizens can attend and determine the spending of local budgets (set based on population and poverty levels).

Well-equipped design teams may divide research up into different categories, then come together in \"affinity sessions\" that present underlying themes for their persona. This information is then used to articulate a narrative specific to that persona, with qualitative data helping round out the edges.\n\nThe second step after prototype development is to create a foundation document for each persona. The foundation document makes explicit the persona's key attributes, work habits, lifestyle, and typical activities. It may also include photos of the persona, taken of real people. This document will inform all further market and user research needs.\n\nOnce a foundation document for each prototype has been written, a kick-off meeting introducing the persona to all members of the design team is held. From then on the foundation document becomes a basic tool in comparison to all the other forms of introduction available. These tools may include websites for the personas with links to quotes, images, the foundation document, etc; posters, fliers, facts-of-the-day all about the persona. The design team is deluded with information on and about each persona.\n\nAmidst this PR for the personas, useful tools are created to help the designers implement the information being thrown at them, as it were.

Ask questions such as, \"Are any of these similar because they can go together as a single larger stage?\" Looking for similarities will regroup members of a domain and help discover more cultural categories and new insights into the cultural scene.\nStep Three: Look for additional included terms - Apply a structural question to each included term such as \"Are there different stages in X process?\" Using structural questions in this way is one of the most powerful devices for expanding observations of ethnographic detail, effectively keeping the observer from overlooking too much important information.\nStep Four: Search for larger, more inclusive domains that might include as a subset the domain you are analyzing - Ask a structural question in reverse such as, \"Is this domain (kinds of trees) a kind of something else?\" or \"Is this domain (stages in shopping) a stage in something else?\"\nStep Five: Construct a tentative taxonomy - Can be represented in a box diagram, a set of lines and nodes, or an outline.\nStep Six: Make focused observations to check on your analysis - Check for missed subparts and structural questions that can be asked at each stage (useful for further observations).\nStep Seven: Construct a completed taxonomy - Construct a taxonomy to represent each domain analyzed."], ["updated_at", Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:19:56 UTC +00:00]]
