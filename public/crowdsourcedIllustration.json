Also, its unclear why some elements are purple while other are red. I think you can play more on map language though. I added a map you can put on the canvas. I’d recommend a faded beige background (it’s okay to use other colors, but try to stick to the palette).  Also, add a compass and a person at the start of the route. I’d also say you can remove one more element from the map, like end on the shopping cart (this really equates to the customer part). ",

I understand that the person with the pencil represents the author, but it does not equate that they made the box. Perhaps adding a white black-outlined thought bubble with a wired box (the author is thinking of the box) to the author and drawing a dashed line from the bubble to the real box will make the connection of author. This might be too busy. Removing the author altogether will be best. I think the box as “evidencing” is great especially how you get at the tangibility aspect. Not a fan of the pencil. Also, make the white space representing the edge of the box large. At small sizes, aliasing makes it difficult to distinguish. ",

This should only be a single section. In this particular one, it looks like you could make the crowd bigger so that part of it overlaps the items that are being choosen. Also, the shape of the items should be the same. This thing is call dots so I’d use dots. I’d make a ballot of some so showing a bar chart maybe?",
