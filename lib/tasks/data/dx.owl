        <Description>This format for brainstorming compresses the essentials of an ideation session into one short format. The numbers 3-12-3 refer to the amount of time in minutes given to each of three activities: 3 minutes for generating a pool of observations, 12 for combining those observations into rough concepts, and 3 again for presenting the concepts back to a group. Essential to this format is strict time keeping (speed is key).</Description>
        <process>1. Prep: Pick a topic on which to brainstorm ideas, boiled down to 2 words (e.g., Tomorrow&apos;s Television). The 2 words can be presented as a full challenge question, such as &quot;&quot;How will tomorrow&apos;s television work?&quot;&quot; it is best to avoid doing this right away. By focusing on 2 words that signify the topic, you will aim to evoke thinking about its defining aspects first, before moving into new concepts or proposing solutions.

2. Set-up: To set up the game distribute a stack of cards and markers to participants. Everyone should have the same number of cards and distribution should happen after rules are given. 

Play (keep strictly to the time limit):
3. First 3 minutes: Generate a pool of characteristics: think about aspects of the topic and write each down on a separate index card.
4. 12 Minutes: Develop concepts: divide the group into pairs. Each team draws 3 cards randomly from the pool. Teams develop concepts from the chosen cards.
5. 3 minutes: Make presentations: Each team presents the concepts they came up with. When presenting to the larger group, teams may reveal the cards that they drew and how the cards influenced their thinking.</process>

        <process>1. Gather 6 participants
2. Give each participant a worksheet.
3. Each participant is tasked with coming up with 3 ideas.
4. After 5 minutes, have each participant pass their worksheet to the next participant.
5. With the new sheet, each participant reads the ideas already present and is encouraged to use them as inspiration for more ideas. 
6. Repeat steps 3-5 six times. This results in 108 ideas (6*3*5) in 30 minutes.

These can now be assessed.</process>

        <Description>When preparing for a meeting, thinking through the 7Ps (Purpose, product, people, process,pitfalls, prep, practical) can improve focus and results, even if you have only a few moments to reflect on them. Note that a great plan can&apos;t guarantee  a great outcome, but it will help lay down the fundamentals from which you can adapt. 

The 7Ps can give you a framework for designing a meeting, but they can&apos;t run the meeting for you. However, developing plans, for meetings or the project as a whole, helps the team work together more efficiently.</Description>
        <process>1. Purpose: Consider the urgency of the meeting; whats going on and whats on fire? If this is difficult to articulate, ask yourself if a meeting is really necessary
2. Product: What specific artifact will we produce out of the meeting? What will it do and how will it serve the purpose?
3. People: Who needs to be there, and what role will they play? 
4. Process: What agenda will the meeting participants use to create the product? Of all the 7Ps, the agenda is where you have the most opportunity to collaborate in advance.
5. Pitfalls: What are the risks of the meeting, and how will they be addressed? 
6. Prep: What would be useful to do in advance? This could be material to read in advance, research to conduct, or homework to assign to the attendees.
7. Practical concerns: These are the logistics of the meeting--the where and when and importantly, who&apos;s bringing lunch?

Each of the 7Ps can influence or change one of the others, and developing a good plan requires taking this into account.</process>

        <process>To conduct this method, use the AEIOU framework as a lens during observations. You might consider bringing pre-formated sheets to help record the observations under the appropriate headings, writing them as a reminder somewhere accessible, or memorizing them (with practice).

Below is how Christina Wasson defines each element of the framework:
-Activities are goal directed sets of actions- things which people want to accomplish
-Environments include the entire arena where actions take place.
-Interactions are between a person and someone or something else, and are the building blocks of activities.
-Object are building blocks of the environment, key elements sometimes put to complex or unintended users, changing their function, meaning and context.
-Users are the consumers, the people providing the behaviors, preferences and needs.

Supplement this method with photos or video, and follow it with processing the data (e.g., clustering observations into higher level themes).</process>
        <Description>&quot;AEIOU&quot; is mneumonic device, to help reserachers remember to pay attention to and code five types of data during observations. Each one of the letters corresponds to a category: Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users. It&apos;s important to not only pay attention to the elements of the framework, but also the interactions between them. 

The AEIOU process should be conducted at the very beginning of your design process so that you understand exactly what and where your product relates to.

The AEIOU framework was originated in 1991 at Doblin by Rick Robinson, Ilya Prokopoff, John Cain, and Julie Pokorny. Its aim was to help analyze Ethnomethodology data and Conversation analysis with MECE (Mutually exclusive/collectively exhaustive) categories.</Description>

        <rdfs:comment>Academic research approach, not a method on it&apos;s own.</rdfs:comment>
        <Description>Action research is a research approach, on par with survey, experimental, or case-based research. In Action Research the researcher typically tries to provide a service to a research &quot;client&quot;, often an organization, and at the same time add to the body of knowledge in a particular domain. In technology-related inquiry, an Action Research study could entail the researcher introducing a new technology in an organization, and at the same time studying the effects of the technology in that organization.</Description>

http://www.institute.nhs.uk/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/action_planning.html&quot;</Description>
        <process>Research data is often collected by studying the organization before and after the introduction of the technology, possibly in cycles (i.e., longitudinally).

Susman and Evered&apos;s (1978) Action Research cycle consists of five stages:
1. Diagnosing: Identifying or defining a problem
2. Action Planning: Consider alternative courses of action
3. Taking Action: Selecting a course of action
4. Evaluating: Studying the consequences of an action
5. Specficying Learning: Identifying general findings</process>
        <Notes>&quot;Six key principles:
1. Reflective Critique
The principle of reflective critique ensures people reflect on issues and processes and make explicit the interpretations, biases, assumptions and concerns upon which judgments are made.  In this way, practical accounts can give rise to theoretical considerations.

2. Dialectical critique
Dialectical critique is required to understand the set of relationships both between the phenomenon and its context, and between the elements constituting the phenomenon.  The key elements to focus attention on are those constituent elements that are unstable, or in opposition to one another.  These are the ones that are most likely to create changes.

3. Collaborative Resource 
The principle of collaborative resource presupposes that each person’s ideas are equally significant as potential resources for creating interpretive categories of analysis, negotiated among the participants.  It strives to avoid the skewing of credibility stemming from the prior status of an idea-holder.  It especially makes possible the insights gleaned from noting the contradictions both between many viewpoints and within a single viewpoint

4. Risk
Initiators of action research will use this principle to allay others’ fears and invite participation by pointing out that they, too, will be subject to the same process, and that whatever the outcome, learning will take place.

5.Plural Structure
This plural structure of inquiry requires a plural text for reporting.  This means that there will be many accounts made explicit, with commentaries on their contradictions, and a range of options for action presented.

6. Theory, Practice, Transformation
For action researchers, theory informs practice, practice refines theory, in a continuous transformation.&quot;</Notes>

Following Skills (Giving the speaker space to tell their story their own way)
- Interested &apos;door openers&apos;

- Attentive silences
Reflecting Skills (restating the feeling and/or content with understanding and acceptance)
- Paraphrase (check periodically that you&apos;ve understood)
- Reflect back feelings and content
- Summarize the major issues&quot;</process>
        <Description>Active listening is a specific communication skill, based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, which involves giving free and undivided attention to the speaker. Knights defines free attention as: ‘... placing all of one’s attention and awareness at the disposal of another person, listening with interest and appreciating without interrupting.’ 

The purpose of Active Listening is to achieve a greater understanding of what the listener is trying to convey. 

In design, Active Listening is especially useful when conducting interviews.</Description>

        <Description>&quot;Activity Analysis is an assessment of a workplace, focused on the tasks performed to acheive a particular objective. It is designed to gather information about the activities, operators behaviors, operating strategies, thought processes and interactions with others in a given situation in the workplace and ways in which they can potentially be made more efficient or valuable. It may include a breakdown of identified activities into their component tasks and sequences to identify the skills and resources required for its completion.

This process should be done in the beginning of the design process so it can better assess activities done at a workplace and tailor activity engagement to maximize efficiency.&quot;</Description>

        <process>&quot;By creating the following three parts, the designer should have insight as to how their product should fit into the existing model and how it would affect actors and artifacts in the system:

1. Activity Map - identifies relevant activities and their interrelationships
2. Activity Profiles - describes the salient aspects of relevant activities
3. Participation Map - shows involvement of actors with the system, with other artifacts, and with other participants&quot;</process>
        <Description>Activity Modeling aims to capture and succinctly represent the salient information regarding activities that are most relevant to design. Creating an activity model will allow the designer to organize information on processes and interactions performed by the target audience. An as-is model maps the current process without the suggested improvements, and a to-be model maps the process with the improvements implemented.</Description>
        <Notes>Deficits of Method:
-Because this method is geared towards practitioners of design, it can be lacking in rigor and formal techniques

Benefits of Method:
-Very systematic and practically oriented.

This method is meant to define the relationship of &quot;actors&quot; in the actor table in terms of how their roles are shared. This method should be used when there are a lot of actors in complicated relatonships. It seeks to answer the questions &quot;Who needs to interact with the system in similar ways?&quot; and &quot;Which roles are unique?&quot; Note that &quot;actors&quot; may include system components, not just human actors.</Description>
        <process>1. Identify each actor (people, organizations, technologies, objects) - document nouns, not verbs
2. Define how each actor is related to each other

Tip: you may want to use stencils or similar placeholders to identify similar objects</process>

        <process>The basic process for creating an affinity diagram is:

1. Put opinions, data, and/or ideas onto cards (or sticky notes), limiting one per card
2. Look for cards that seem to be related
3. Group similar items

Teams may want to name the groups, or sort large clusters into subgroups for easier management and analysis. You may also want to restart a few times to get at different ways of organizing the information and/or perspectives.

Variations include:
 - anonymizing the cards by distributing the cards randomly before sorting (this may be important in some sensitive situations where people may feel judged for the cards they contribute)
 - silent organizing
 - reading each card aloud and asking for similar cards
 - color coding each card/sticky in particular ways to code more information (see Contextual Inquiry)</process>
        <Description>The affinity diagram is a creative process used for organizing large amounts of data, ideas and insights by identifying their natural correlations. The purpose of an affinity diagram is to sort large amounts of data into logical groups, but it can be used for problem identification, defining the circumstances, diagnosis and problem-formulation, solutions and working hypotheses, activation of solutions, programmed application of solutions.  In some cases, users or other stakeholders may be involved.

Most often, affinity diagrams are used to analyze findings from field studies, identify and group user functions as part of design, or analyze findings from a usability evaluation.</Description>

        <Description>Appreciative Inquiry sets out to discover elements and factors in an organization that enable it to succeed and then build on those elements to help the organization succeed. 

The questions used in this method are designed to encourage people to tell stories from their own experience of what works. By discussing what has worked in the past and the reasons why, the participants can go on to imagine and create a vision of what would make a successful future that has a firm grounding in the reality of past successes.</Description>

        <process>Appreciative Inquiry has two key steps, followed by implementation steps. The key steps are:
1. &quot;Define&quot; the situation, using positive language (e.g., &apos;Ways to accelerate recruitment&apos; rather than &apos;Ways to fix the recruitment problem&apos;)
2. &quot;Discover&quot; what the best past examples are by collecting stories from as many people as you sensibly can. Try to identify &quot;life giving forces&quot;.Questions should be designed to get people to tell sstories about what they find most valuable or what works particularly well.

You may follow this with whatever processing/ideation/building methods you prefer, but the method suggests using the following &quot;implementation steps&quot;, continuing to involve organization/community members in each:
3. &quot;Dream&quot; of what could be, identifying ways to reinforce the positives found in the last stage.
4. &quot;Design&quot; ways to create that future, dealing with practicalities and needed resources. What are the systems, processes, and strategies needed?
5. &quot;Deliver&quot; by starting to implement the design.</process>
        <Notes>&quot;Appreciative Inquiry uses &quot;&quot;understanding-through-empathy&quot;&quot; during first-hand interviews with stakeholders of the organization. Its bias is toward the direct interaction with and observation of the people in an organization rather than a detached analysis of facts, figures, charts, benchmark comparisons, and discussions with executives only.

Questions often revolve around what people enjoy about an area, their aspirations for the future, and their feelings about their communities. 

&quot;&quot;In 1990 David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney published an article outlining the five principles of Appreciative Inquiry that have become the standard model used by practitioners and researchers. The following description is taken from the Sage Encyclopedia of Management Theory:

1) The constructionist principle proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships. Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit. The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.

2) The principle of simultaneity proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked. Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.

3) The poetic principle proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored. The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves. They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.

4) The anticipatory principle posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future. Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative Inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.

5) The positive principle proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding. Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility. They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.&quot;&quot; (Wikipedia)&quot;</Notes>

        <Description>Attitude Questionnaires are types of surveys (or a portion of a larger survey) designed to gather information about how a user feels about the product/situation being tested.  This is distinct from the efficiency or effectiveness of the product, and may be coupled with questions pertaining to those aspects.

The questionnaire usually produces a list of satisfying and unsatisfying features, which is especially useful if testing is taking place during development.</Description>
        <aka>Subjective Assessment</aka>
        <rdfs:seeAlso>Attitude_Questionnaire</rdfs:seeAlso>
        <process>The usual method of assessment is to used a standardized opinion questionnaire to avoid criticisms of subjectivity.

1. Identify or develop the questionnaire you will use. You may want to use a mix of closed-ended and open-ended questions.  Often, Likert-Style questions (e.g., Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) will be used to quantify the qualitative opinions of respondents. However, in these cases it is recommended to include statements that contridict each other to screen for people who simply mark one category without considering the question.

As with other surveys, the quality of the assessment will benefit by doing some preliminary study to inform the question development.

2. Administer the survey to your target population. For more on sampling, see Recruitment Methods. If you are doing a mass mailing, expect an approximate 20% response rate, possibly higher with online communications (e.g., email). You can increase your response rate to nearly 100% by doing reminder personal calls if you have that capability.

If you are using the questionnaire as part of a lab test, ensure that the completed questionnaires can be associated with all the other data (time scores, tapes, sample outputs etc.) from the respondents,  so you don’t have questionnaires which you cannot match up with the rest of the data.

Do not prompt the respondent on how to reply. If a respondent says that a question is inapplicable or wrong, tell them words to the effect that it is up to them to make their own judgement about each question, and that there are no right or wrong answers. Encourage them not to skip questions.

3. Collect questionnaires from respondents for analysis.</process>

        <Description>According to Cunningham and Jones&apos; article, autoethnography is an ethnography (empirical first-hand research) focused on the self. It is a process in which the author is both the informant and the investigator.It is useful for uncovering personal biases and preconceptions that could interfere with the design system. The designer also gains experience in thinking of the self as a member of and outsider to a group, placing his or her activities within an analytic context.

Autoethnography is used at the beginning of the design stage when designers want to better understand how a consumer views and interacts with the product in question. This method can also be an inexpensive means to test out ethnographic procedures prior to initiating a larger-scale study.</Description>

        <Description>Behavioral archaeology is the study of material objects, regardless of time or space, in order to describe human behavior, building on the theory that artifacts, architecture and other items in a work or living space are the product of human actions. Behavioral archeology focuses on observing and understanding what people actually did or do, while refraining from considering people’s thoughts and intentions in explaining that behaviour. This method reveals how artifacts and environments figure in people&apos;s lives, highlighting aspects of their lifestyle, habits, priorities, and values.

Behavioral Archaeology can be used to investigate both past and present human behaviors (and is used as an approach to archaeological research). However,  for design, it is most useful for 
1. Designing Long-term behavioral change by developing laws that represent both past and present human behavior and uses.
2. Answering questions about ongoing societies/Uses by studying present material objects in current cultural systems to describe and explain present human behavior.</Description>
        <process>Collect and/or examine artifacts or evidence of artifacts (i.e., observe the material surroundings and behaviors that produce them). 

Examine and/or document behavior or sequences of behavior without considering the actor&apos;s thoughts or intentions. There are three scales to consider:
a. Interaction scale: focus on regularity and variation in single person-object interactions. Universal principles of behavior might be discovered.
b. Activity Scale: variation in activities performed by individuals, or groups is examined. An activity may be defined as a set of sequentially related interactions that takes place in a location, among interactors that at least need one person or an artefact.
c. Systemic scale: in an organization of one or more behavioral systems (a set of patterned activities that make up a human group such as household, community, etc.)</process>

Frequently, this kind of prototype is &quot;quick and dirty,&quot; not built to project standards. For example, Visual Basic may be used as the prototyping language, while C++ is intended for the development project. Exploratory prototypes are temporary, are done with minimal effort, and are thrown away once they have served their purpose.</Description>

2. Represents the quantities accurately.
3. Makes it easy to compare the quantities.
4. Makes it easy to see the ranked order of values, such as from the leading cause of death to the least.
5. Makes obvious how people should use the information - what they should use it to accomplish - and encourages them to do this.

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&DesignExchange_Methods;Ideating"/>
        <Description>Brain storming is one of the oldest known methods for generating group creativity. A group of people come together and focus on a problem or proposal.

Although some studies have shown that individuals working alone can generate more and better ideas than when working as a group, the brainstorming activity enables everyone in the group to gain a better understanding of the problem space, and has the added benefit of creating a feeling of common ownership of results.

To maximize the range of ideas, you might have participants work alone first and then work as a group. This allows the team to tap into the individual creativity of each member, and then build on each others ideas.</Description>
        <process>There are two phases of the activity. The first phase generates ideas, the second phase evaluates them. An experienced facilitator is useful.  Alex F. Osborn outlined four rules, which others (such as IDEO) have expanded upon:
1. Focus on quantity: This rule is a means of enhancing divergent production, aiming to facilitate problem solving through the maxim quantity breeds quality. The assumption is that the greater the number of ideas generated, the greater the chance of producing a radical and effective solution.
2. Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas generated should be put &apos;on hold&apos;. Instead, participants should focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a later &apos;critical stage&apos; of the process. By suspending judgment, participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
3. Welcome unusual ideas: To get a good and long list of ideas, unusual ideas are welcomed. They can be generated by looking from new perspectives and suspending assumptions. These new ways of thinking may provide better solutions.
4. Combine and improve ideas: Good ideas may be combined to form a single better good idea, as suggested by the slogan &quot;1+1=3&quot;. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.</process>

        <Description>This is similar to Brainstorming, but rather than sharing ideas verbally, participants are asked to write their ideas silently, often sharing by passing paper between them.

        <process>A typical CARD session progresses as follows:
1. Introducing People - Team members introduce their names, workplace group interests, etc.
2. Introducing Materials - Each person fills out his/her card with an activity or component of an activity that could occur in the workplace.
3. Work of the Session - The team engages in three sessions of deep involvement:
- Participatory Analysis - Each user describes his or her work and the other members ask questions
- Participatory Design - The entire team discusses a user&apos;s work and/or possible innovations in work practice and technologies.
- Participatory Assessment - The entire team collectively critiques a specific work practice.</process>
        <Description>The CARD (Collaborative Analysis of Requirement and Design) technique is a meeting documentation method. It essentially creates cards that explain the results of a discussion or series of discussions, all of which can be used for more formal analytical techniques. This method is used to help the Design Team&apos;s members better understand each other&apos;s backgrounds and work history, as well as brainstorm innovations to improve the current design process. It could also be used as a workshop-technique, where participants are members of an organization under study, rather than members of the design team. In this case, design team members may act as facilitators and/or observers.</Description>

        <Description>Canonical abstract prototypes use a toolkit of standardized abstract interface components (refraining from specifying details of appearance or behavior) to help specify and explore visual and interaction design ideas. The standardized components are meant to help bridge between abstract models (e.g., task flows and wireframes) and realistic or representational prototypes (e.g., photoshop mockups). 

As described by Constatine et al., these prototypes:
· are constructed from specific abstract components selected from a toolkit of standard components described in a uniform notation 
· show layout, including relatives size, position, and nesting or overlay of components 
· use the same standard vocabulary of the users and application domain as employed in other models throughout a project

Canonical Abstract Prototyping is appropriate when attempting to take a task model and create a complete yet abstract conceptual design for the entire user interface. This makes generating a realistic model more straightforward.</Description>
        <process>The set consists of three generic or all-purpose abstract components (the container, the action/operation, and the active material) plus an assortment of auxiliary, special-purpose components that have proved useful in practice (e.g., elements, collections, select, delete, editable elements, etc.). Since all the materials are effectively specializations of the generic container and all the tools are specializations of the generic operation/action, generic components can always be used for any purpose. For conventional designs, each canonical component is simply realized by one or more standard user interface widgets.

To generate the canonical abstract model from a task model:
1. For each cluster of closely related task cases, an interaction context is provisionally defined. For each task case in a cluster, the defining dialog or narrative is examined.
2. For each step in the narrative, the interface contents necessary for performance of the step are identified and appropriate abstract tools and materials are added to the contents of the interaction context. In practice, this is often accomplished using sticky notes to represent abstract components
3. Where specialized Canonical Abstract Components are clearly needed or preferred, these are used; otherwise, generic tools, materials, or combinations are used. Canonical Abstract Components model the various interactive functions–such as interrupting an action or displaying a collection of information–needed within the realized user interface.
4. Once all the necessary tools and materials have been incorporated into the interaction context, the layout and organization of the interaction context are explored. Area is allocated based on such things as importance, complexity, and user focus.
5. Abstract Components are positioned according to such issues as workflow and conceptual or semantic interrelationships and may be by combined into composite components when meaningful and potentially useful.</process>
        <aka>Balsamiq wireframes, standardized wireframes</aka>
        <Notes>Constantine, et al., claim that using a common abstract design vocabulary facilitates comparison between designs, as well as recognition and description of common design patterns. 

Benefits of this Method:
Design process is more manageable while allowing human creativity and thought to be more targeted toward the important aspects of the design

Deficits of this Method:
Significant details for implementation and realization are not recognized at this stage, leaving it up to resolution by a designer.

In many ways, this method is represented by tools such as Balsamiq that provide a standard set of interface widgets to build an interactive wireframe mockup, though system behavior can also be modeled in Balsamiq.</Notes>

        <Description>Card Sorting essentially involves the design team selecting a group of people to organize cards spatially, in ways that make sense to them. The respondents could be potential users or other stakeholders. When cards are sorted by members of the design team, it would generally be considered a form of affinity diagramming, a similar method in terms of process (though different in purpose). 

Given a large group of independent respondents, numerical analysis of the resulting sorting can reveal important trends and patterns of the general consumer market. Alternatively, a respondent&apos;s card sort can be used to spur discussion in an interview setting.

Card Sorting is usually used to gather information from users, either to understand which perspectives the users will value most about the product in question, help structure information in an intuitive way, or towards the end of the design process to check and perhaps correct and/or enhance the product to meet the users&apos; preferences, values, and innate understanding.</Description>
        <rdfs:comment>should we list out the setting possibilities as individual submethods?</rdfs:comment>
        <Notes>Sessions can be run in four contexts:

1. 1:1 - in this setting, the facilitator and respondent are in the same space. Respondents are asked to think aloud while sorting, and facilitators may look on and ask questions as needed.
2. Group/Independent - multiple in-person sessions happen at the same time, but respondents each sort their own set of cards independently with little interaction with the facilitator or other respondents.
3. Group - In this setting, a group of respondents works together to sort the cards. This may bring about groupings and labels more quickly, but may lose the variation in how different respondents think about the information being sorted.
4. Remote - in this setting, the respondent works on their own computer away from the facilitator. In general, the respondent will work completely independently, though an audio or video call may be set up to allow the facilitator to observe or listen to the respondent working. Several software programs that support this activity will analyze the collected data for you.

Benefits of the method: The users can utilize all their senses when investigating the cards allowing them to possibly create new categories of sorting that may not have appeared before.

Deficits of the method: 
Often times, the objects can have strange and/or unwanted relationships that skew the sorting away from the intended categories and perspectives. Furthermore, the sorting can only address &quot;static, flat, [and] explicit knowledge,&quot; rather than providing more tacit knowledge about structured relationships.</Notes>

        <process>Who: 
1. Recruit members of your target audience (usually 4-10)
2. Schedule the participants so that there can be someone nearby to answer questions

What: 
3. On a deck of sturdy identical  (to minimize distractions) cards, write succinct descriptions of the things you want organized (e.g., sections of a website, terms you might use, areas of interest, etc.) - putting too much information on the cards can slow down the process. What you write on the cards should reflect what you&apos;re trying to learn about or test. It&apos;s recommended to shoot for 30-100 cards to provide enough items to sort, while not overwhelming the respondent. For an open sort, you may want to err on the smaller end of this range.

How:
4. Bring the participant in and get them settled.
5. Introduce the card sort concept (e.g, &quot;this is a stack of cards, please sort them into groups that make sense to you&quot;). If possible, randomize the order of presentation so that each piece of content has a chance to be sorted earlier in the session.
6. After the respondant is done grouping, you might have them help you label the groups.
7. Depending on how many cards you have, you might have the respondent do a second round by grouping the groups together into larger groups and then also labeling those (also see: Hierarchical Sort).

After:
For a more formal analysis, consider Cluster Analysis (a numeric technique)
For a less formal analysis, you can eyeball how people group things, paying attention to what they don&apos;t group as well.</process>

        <Description>The character profiles is a tool for the creation of a shared knowledgeabout the service users inside the team. In order to build these character profiles it’s required the identification of some significant fictitious characters and then the collecting of an image and a textual description for each one of them.
The character profiles offer a clear and visible picture of the different kinds of users that are the centre of the design activities.

This method is most useful early in the design process when trying to share learnings about the user and how he/she interacts with his/her environment, but can also be used as concept inspiration, or as an initial evaluation tool.</Description>

        <Notes>&quot;While not as indepth as a community-wide visioning event may be, a citizen advisory group allows your planning commission to gain insight into important preferences as determined by a sample of your community’s experience and expertise. Whenever a group of people converge to discuss a planning topic, you are likely to observe community-held opinions.&quot; (UVM)</Notes>
        <aka>Advisory Groups</aka>
        <Description>&quot;Citizen advisory groups involve 10-30 members of the public who sit as a committee to inform and advise decision making over an extended period of time. Advisory groups can create effective and on-going dialogue that allow issues and concerns to be explored in depth, and ideally addressed, while the participants are still involved.&quot; (ParticipationCompass)

Depending on the purpose, the group may take different forms (representative sample, group representatives, or particular individuals). The group needs to have access to relevant information and may meet either over a couple of days as a one-off event, or regularly over a longer period. Most costs come from recruitment and retention of members, rather than in the running of the meetings themselves.</Description>
        <process>Tips:
1. Find the right people: Bring on those most affected first, then those who are generally interested, and then fill in any missing areas of expertise.
2.  Get the group organized: Develop a clear goal, keep members focused on choices, and highlight underlying values of the issues.
3. Give them the problem—and stand behind their decision(s) or product(s).
4. Make everyone’s role clear: Maintain the focus and let the citizens make the choices.</process>

        <references>Characteristic:</references>
        <Notes>This evolved from Opinion Polls and Market Research techniques. Some tips include:
 - Let panel members know what is expected of them during recruitment (e.g., surveys 4-6 times/year, little face-to-face engagement if any, how long they&apos;ll be on the panel, etc.)
 - Engage the panel to 4-6 times per year (some will do once per month, but that may lead to participants dropping out), spaced throughout the year.
 - Vary the form of engagement so participants have a choice in how to be involved (i.e., provide more than just a regular survey).
 - Distribute outcomes of the feedback to participants (consider a newsletter) and the public.
 - Use this method in conjunction with others.</Notes>
        <process>1. Recruit members of community or target population to be members
2. Administer surveys periodically, and possibly conduct more indepth research (such as Focus Groups or Interviews) to monitor public opinion.</process>
        <Description>A citizens&apos; panel aims to be a representative consultative body of local residents and is typically used by statutory agencies, particularly local authorities and their partners, to identify local priorities and to consult service users and non-users on specific issues. In reality, panels are rarely demographically representative of the public and very few ensure that members represent a cross-section of political or social attitudes.</Description>

        <process>1. The event is structured on work sessions which correspond to the main themes on the public agenda: finding solutions, prioritizing the solution on the main target groups and the selection of the best solutions. 
2. The participants are organized in groups which are moderated by sociologist. 
3. The debates are conceived in sequences, using the focus group methodology and are integrated by the simultaneous votes they receive at the end of each session.</process>
        <Description>Citizens&apos; Summits are deliberative meetings involving large numbers of people (typically between 500-5000) and using communication technology to facilitate discussions.

The technology, which includes electronic voting, text messages, and online surveys, makes it possible to engage large numbers of people in the same place, at the same time. Citizens&apos; summits trace their background to 21st Century Town Meetings and the work of AmericaSpeaks in the USA.

The advantage of a public debate is that it brings the local authorities closer to the citizens and the latter closer to the decision making process, increasing thus their involvement in the community. It is an event that catches the mass media&apos;s eye, that is easily disseminated and benefits from a modern methodology which offers the best ratio in terms of information, time and costs.

        <process>1. Invite users to collaborate with designers, researchers, and/or developers.
2. Then, an assessment of the needs of the users or community, with input from the users.
3. Working with users/community members to design and prototype a product/space/solution.

The designers should provide ways for people to engage with each other as well as instruments for communication, creativity, sharing insights and envisioning their own ideas.</process>
        <Description>Co-designing is an approach to the design process which attempts to involve all stakeholders (designers, employees, end users, etc.) in the design process. The central tenet of co-design is that the expert designer and the end user both have expertise to share: the designer on design processes, materials, etc., and the end user on their needs and what works for them. Stakeholders can contribute by helping to define the problem, develop ideas, and evaluate proposed solutions. 

In situations where users are meant to be empowered, it is important that both the designer and the end user contribute and control the process - i.e., working hand in hand. In general, the designer will find themselves acting more as a facilitator than a director of the process. Co-design is touted as particularly useful for creating solutions (products, services, environments, etc.) that are more responsive and appropriate to users&apos; cultural, emotional, spiritual and practical needs.</Description>

        <Notes>Tips:
 - Add meaning to concepts by phrasing concepts in the imperative form and including actors and actions if possible.
 - Retain the words and phrases used by the problem owner to let them retain ownership, but avoid beginning phrases with &quot;need..&quot;, &quot;must..&quot; or &quot;want..&quot; since they may confuse the causal relationship later.
 - Start mapping about 2/3rds of the way up the paper in the middle.
 - Try to keep concepts in small rectangles of text (rather than continuous lines).
 - If possible, keep all concepts on one sheet of paper for easier linking later (30-40 is usually possible)
 - Use soft pencils so you can easily rewrite (or stickies).</Notes>

        <Description>Cognitive Mapping is a diagram that represents relationships between concepts, where the concepts are linked by cause/effect, means/ends, or how/why relationships. Cognitive Maps were designed to support decision making, so the cause and effect link is essentially to help trace the possible desirable and undesirable outcomes of a decision. Unlike mind maps or concept maps, cognitive maps rarely use words or images as nodes - rather, each node is a phrase expressing an idea, ideally with a verb incorporated (e.g., &quot;increase morale&quot;). In addition, the idea may be &quot;bi-polar&quot; meaning it has contrasting options (e.g., &quot;increase morale rather than decrease morale&quot;; &quot;long wait rather than less than 3 minute wait&quot;). The portion before the &quot;rather than&quot; is the actual outcome, and the portion after is the avoided outcome. 

&quot;Cognitive Map&quot; can also refer to the map someone has in their head of how the world works, which becomes a mental model or mental map once written or drawn.</Description>
        <process>Basic Process:
1. Break a problem into its constituent elements (usually distinct phrases of 10-12 words), retaining the language of the person giving the account of the problem.
2. Treat each phrase as a single concept, and lay them out in a graphical format (with stickies on a whiteboard, on a computer program, etc.). A pair of phrases may be combined into a single phrase/concept if one provides a meaningful contrast to the other (i.e., makes a bi-polar concept)
3. Link phrases based on their cause/effect relationships, to form a hierarchy of means and ends.

Guidelines (some of which apply specifically if you are using this as a note-taking technique during an interview):
 - Separate sentences into distinct phrases.
 - Choose a way to distinguish between types of concepts (e.g., Goals, Strategic Directions, Potential Options) - consider hierachical layout or color coding.
 - Watch out for goals, since they usually don&apos;t come out in the beginning of the explanation of the problem, but are often indicated by body language or intonation, or emphatic expressions of their &quot;goodness.&quot; Goals are considered &quot;good things per se&quot; by the problem owner.
 - Watch out for Strategic Directions - these are higher level concepts that may have a longer term implication, high cost, or need a number of actions to make them happen.
 - Look for opposite poles - you may add them later in the interview/meeting as they are mentioned
 - Identify the option and outcome within each pair of concepts by linking them with an arrow.</process>

        <Description>Cognitive walkthrough involves one or a group of evaluators inspecting a user interface by going through a set of tasks and evaluate its understandability and ease of learning. The user interface is often presented in the form of a paper mock-up or a working prototype, but it can also be a fully developed interface. The input to the walkthrough also include the user profile, especially the users&apos; knowledge of the task domain and of the interface, and the task cases. The evaluators may include human factors engineers, software developers, or people from marketing, documentation, etc. This technique is best used in the design stage of development. But it can also be applied during the code, test, and deployment stages.</Description>

        <Description>Competitive analysis identifies the strengths and weaknesses of competing products or services by systematically surveying other offerings. This method helps to increase awareness about ways in which other companies are solving similar problems, serves as a guide for how existing products can be improved on, and can help guide user research. It may be used to help establish functional requirements, performace standards and other benchmarks.</Description>
        <process>1. Collect a list of possible competitors. This may be restricted to products in the immediate market space, or as broad as the other ways people fill their time, or currently get relevant needs met depending on the context.
2. Develop a list of characteristics or success factors to compare between competitors based on expected customer benefits.
3. For each competitive option, collect information on those characteristics (this may require purchasing the option, interviewing users of the other options, or simply finding the information on the internet) and rate their success. The goal is to capture what each product does well and where it could be improved upon.
4. Organize collected information in a table to facilitate comparisons. Consider including weighting factors for more or less important characteristics.</process>

        <Description>A concept map is a diagram that connects concepts (generally nouns) with arrows labeled with linking words (generally verbs such as causes, requires, etc.) in a downward branching hierarchy.  A key difference between concept mapping and mindmapping is that mindmaps generally have a central concept with a radial or tree structure, whereas concept maps may have multiple root concepts.

In education, Concept Mapping is used as a tool for designing and structuring curricula; also for helping students better retain information. Concept mapping can be utilized in multiple ways including: lesson planning, study guides, and tutorial outlines.</Description>

        <process>1. Identify a particular activity or topic you would like to understand more completely. It is most effective to clearly define the range of the topic so as keep the map contained and focused. Writing a Focus Question is a good way to define the domain of the map.
2. Generate a list of 15-20 concepts and rank them from general to specific as they relate to the focus question. 
3. Construct a preliminary map (using paper or computer based tools), organizing the concepts hierarchically based on the ranking in Step 2.
4. Move the concepts around until (by trial and error) the best hierarchy is reached.
5. Add cross-links between subdomains in the map.
6. Add linking words to define relationships between concepts.
7. Revise and rewrite until a final map emerges that answers the focus question.

Ultimately, concept mapping will result in a chart of ideas and their relationships to one another. This form of structuring topics enables the creator to visually understand and review how an overall Focus Question can be broken down into relevant sub-domains of important related concepts.</process>

        <Description>Conjoint analysis allows researchers to establish how much consumers value individual features of products or services.

Conjoint analysis can be used after there is a final product and a marketing strategy wants to be developed; which features to emphasize and what price to sell it at. It can also be used to determine what specific features and combination of features consumers find to be most important before designing a product.</Description>

        <Description>A consensus conference is made up of a panel of citizens who question expert witnesses on a particular topic at a public conference. Their recommendations are then circulated widely. 

A feature of this method is that the initiative lies with the citizens- they who define what the key points of the debate will be, including the choice of questions and selection of the witnesses -they create their own final conclusions. 

In common with Citizens&apos; Juries, Consensus Conferences aim to both inform and consult, but Consensus Conferences take place in the public gaze.</Description>
        <process>1. Invite a group of citizens (members of the lay public who have no specific knowledge of the issue at hand) to apply, and choose participants to be as demographically representative of the public as possible.
2. Participants attend two preparatory weekends, and given material prepared to gain a basic understanding of the issue.
3. The panel participates in a 4-day conference where they attend Q&amp;A sessions with experts, including opposing views.
4. The citizen participants prepare a final report with their views, opinions, and recommendations for the issue.
5. On the last day of the conference, the citizens discuss their views with policy- and decision-makers.</process>

        <Description>Evidencing is related to paper prototyping but has several important differences. Firstly, evidencing has to look finished and convincing, whereas often a paper prototype is designed to look like a rough first draft. This is because the aim is to provide a convincing example of something ‘in the future’. Secondly, evidencing aims to give the experience of how the service will be experienced when completed. It is therefore strong on contextual information regarding its use. Thirdly, evidencing aims to lead by example, or pull a project, by making tangible the end point of the process. Finally, evidencing presents a solution in a holistic way, including branding elements, design elements, interaction elements and behavioural elements. </Description>

        <Description>Evolutionary prototypes, as their name implies, evolve from one iteration to the next. While not initially production quality, their code tends to be reworked as the product evolves. In order to keep rework manageable, they tend to be more formally designed and somewhat formally tested even in the early stages. As the product evolves, testing becomes formalized, as usually does design</Description>

The authors emphasize that experience prototyping is not about the creation of a formalized toolkit or a set of techniques, but is rather about developing an attitude and language to solve design problems.

This method is essential to the middle stages of the designing process (i.e. before the final artifacts exist).&quot;</rdfs:comment>

A heuristic or expert evaluation can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, although it is preferable to have already performed some form of context analysis to help the experts focus on the circumstances of actual or intended product usage.</Description>

        <Description>An exploratory prototype is designed to be like a small &quot;experiment&quot; to test some key assumption about the project, either functionality or technology or both. It might be something as small as a few hundred lines of code, created to test the performance of a key software or hardware component. Or it may be a way of clarifying requirements, a small prototype developed to see if the developer understands a particular behavioral or technical requirement.

Exploratory prototypes tend to be intentionally &quot;throw-away&quot;, and testing of them tends to be informal. The design of exploratory prototypes tends to be very informal, and also tends to be the work of one or two developers at most.</Description>

        <Description>This method requires volunteers who are either extremely familiar or completely unfamiliar with a product, a notebook, paper &amp; pencil, appropriate environment for using the product under question/review.

Users who are either extremely familiar or completely unfamiliar with a product are asked to evaluate their experience of using it. 

1. Identify Extreme Users for your particular challenge.
2. Ask them to describe their experience in very specific terms–the more detail the better.  If you can film or photograph, do so.
3. Observe your results and generate multiple insights.
4. Use the Extreme Users as inspiration for generating solutions.</Description>
        <Description>Extreme User Interviews utilize the perspectives of users at opposite ends of the familiarity spectrum. 

This is most appropriate in the beginning of the design process when trying to evaluate what flaws are apparent in current models of a product.</Description>

        <Description>Focus Group (FG) is a type of in-depth interview, during the data collection stage of a research project. The researcher invites informants whose characteristics represent those of the target research population, and collect data by engaging the participants in conversations. The focus or object of analysis is the interaction inside the group.

The questions asked in a focus group are similar to those asked in an one-on-one interview.

        <Description>Heuristic evaluation is a form of usability inspection where usability specialists judge whether each element of a user interface follows a list of established usability heuristics.     

  
A heuristic or expert evaluation can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, although it is preferable to have already performed some form of context analysis to help the experts focus on the circumstances of actual or intended product usage.

It is beneficial to carry out a heuristic evaluation on early prototypes before actual users are brought in to help with further testing.</Description>

        <Description>Identity Construction is used primarily as a part of Human Centered Design to improve the user experience and emphasize the importance of users in the entire design process.  Indentity Construction focuses on the user and the user only. From this research method, the design team can learn more about the users&apos; lives and can effectively use this knowledge when designing the product itself as a means to make it more personal, which is generally what the user prefers.

Construction is best used in the phase of the design process in which UCD (User-centered Design) is more relevant. This is generally used before a product is released into the market, but may also be used before product development and/or prototyping begins</Description>

        <Description>Immersive workshop is a workshop that replicates and accelerates the front end stages of a typical design development process and can be tailored to the specific aims of its organizers through the framing of the brief and the selection of participants.

This method is best used for rapid revelation, demonstration and analysis of issues, knowledge generation and knowledge transfer, and brainstorming and visualization of new design concepts.

It takes designers out of their comfort zones, enabling them to envisage issues and scenarios of which they may have been unaware.</Description>

        <Description>Improvization is a way of thinking with your body. Example role play, where you take the role of a character, imagine a situation, and act as you you think your character would act in that situation. 

Improvisation can be used in many different ways to facilitate the design process. It can increase creativity, innovative thinking, teamwork, constructive thought, spontaneity, ability to work towards a common goal and presentation skills, while it decreases fear of failure, and self promoting action</Description>

        <Description>This plan supplies examples, facts, or reasons first and then draws conclusions from them.  Inductive organization is useful when readers are uninformed or when resistance or antagonism is expected.  For example, a report written to convince management to fund an employee fitness program might begin with the advantages of a fitness program:  improved job satisfaction, reduced absenteeism and turnover, improved productivity, and lower health care costs.   After describing the benefits, the report writer could draw the conclusion that a company-sponsored fitness program is a wise investment.  Starting with the main idea first risks the chance that readers opposed to the idea will read no further.</Description>

        <Description>Intervention is a method in which  the designer places 2D graphic visualisations or 3D objects within an environment to stimulate discussion and elicit a response from the user. 

These designed elements take the form of interventions or provocations within the research process, engaging a person’s imagination and encouraging a fuller response in ways that more formal interview and questionnaire techniques cannot achieve.

Thie purpose of this method is to elicit greater engagement by the user and better understanding of their motivation

This method should be used in the earlier stages of the design process – exploration and focus.</Description>

        <aka>Exploratory Prototype</aka>
        <Description>&quot;Low Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Prototypes essentially are paper prototypes that are extremely quick to make and that allow designers to demonstrate the behavior of an interface very early in development, and test designs with real users.

Low Fidelity Prototypes are appropriate to use when it is necessary that the prototyping process “is fast, it brings results early in development (when it is relatively cheap to make changes), and allows a team to try far more ideas than they could with high-fidelity prototypes.

An Exploratory Prototype is a throw-away prototype used to clarify project goals, to identify requirements, to examine alternative designs, or to investigate a large and complex system.

Exploratory prototypes are used when it is necessary for a small experiment to be conducted about a key assumption about the design, ranging from its functionality, to its technical requirements etc.&quot;</Description>

It&apos;s useful for taking notes in meetings or interviews (though that takes practice), or for organizing information in a free association mind dump.</Description>

        <process>1. Find a large blank space to work on (wall, whiteboard, paper, mindmapping software).
2. Place a problem, idea or central thought in the center of the space, ideally as an image, but a word or short phrase will also work.
3. From the central concept, draw &quot;branches&quot; for related concepts or ideas. These should be your primary categories, as their central location in the map tends to indicate increased importance. These can be words, ideas, tasks, or other items. 
4. For each branch, add additional related (or secondary) concepts or ideas (generally more granular as you move out). Connect the primary and secondary categories with lines.
5. Repeat the process with each smaller branch until you feel all relevant information has been included.

Tips from Buzan:
- Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
- Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
- Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
- Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
- The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The central lines are thicker, organic and thinner as they radiate out from the center.
- Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
- Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also to encode or group.
- Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
- Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
- Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy, numerical order or outlines to embrace your branches.</process>

        <Description>* Naturalistic group interview is an interview technique that allows the researcher to collect information from naturally occurring conversations stemming from the fact that the people chosen for the group interviews all have a previous social relationship with each other.  Group influence tends to be ubiquitous in Asian countries, and it is therefore important to take this group dynamic into account in order to fully understand consumer behavior in this context


Purpose:  Goal of naturalistic group interviewing is to collect empirical data in the natural setting in which a consumption activity normally takes place.


Context: It is appropriate to use this quantitative analytic method at the beginning of the research process, when one is trying to find out consumer beliefs about something.
This method is appropriate for cultures that consider it taboo for people to disclose their thoughts and opinions, or where attitudes and beliefs tend to be formed at the group rather than the individual level.

        <Description>Netnography (Internet + Ethnography) is an online marketing research technique for providing consumer insight. It is used because it considered to be much faster, simpler, and less expensive than traditional ethnography. It also has the advantage of being more naturalistic and unobtrusive, since you are learning about user behavior via the internet.</Description>

        <Description>
Online consultations utilise the internet to ask a group of people their opinion on an issue (typically a policy in the development stages). An unlimited number of participants can be sent information about the subject or download it online and respond via email or comment on the website.

Online consultation enables participants to comment in detail and those commissioning the process to collate responses and present the results back to participants quickly, comprehensively and transparently. The fact that the participant comments do not need to be transcribed adds real benefit and speeds up analysis.

Context: You should use an online consultation when:
• There is a clear and achievable aim
• Dealing with a large and/or widely dispersed group of participants
• Participants are more comfortable participating online than in other ways

        <Notes>Benefits of Method:
-Increase understanding of the phenomenon being studied
-A good way to analyze data from interview transcripts

Deficits of Method: 
-Personal histories of the researchers may influence findings
-Researchers&apos; academic training may influence coding practices
-Time consuming</Notes>
        <process>To make use of this, realistically, it&apos;s useful to do several iterations. Using the terms from Grounded Theory, this means:

1. Mark key points of data with codes. Expect a cycle of discussion, immersion of new coding themes, and revision of codes.
2. Group codes into concepts.
3. Group concepts into categories.
4. Use categroies to create a &quot;theory&quot; (i.e., a collection of explanations that explain the subject of the research)

Guidelines:
 - Used a recursive, iterative process to develop the codes, discussing among the research team to support and understand the codes. 
 - Use a codebook to document decisions, definitions, and rules of coding. Revise after discussion and as themes emerge.</process>
        <Description>Open coding is a coding system where there is no predefined set of codes before you begin tagging your data. The theory is that the themes and concepts should emerge from the data.</Description>

        <Description>QFD stands for Quality Function Deploymentrn. It is a market-driven methodology for products and services to meet or exceed customers needs and expectations. 

QFD helps classify consumers&apos; needs and wants into the appropriate design and delivery functions of one&apos;s organization. Using QFD with value engineering gives the customers what they value as important for themselves; it also helps your organization prioritize what characteristics to build into the product. 

The major goal for performing market research, analyzing the data with QFD, synthesizing results with value engineering and plotting them using value graphs are to incorporate customer voice during early design stages, improve quality, functionality, innovations, responsiveness and upgrade enterprise infrastructure. The goal for a company is to develop a product that consumers like-- and companies do this by figuring out what customers likes and desires are.

QFD-based Value Engineering should be used in the beginning of the design process. The method can be applied to develop a product that consumers like and will purchase.

        <Description>Q Sorts are a type of card sort where respondents are asked to fit the cards into a normal distribution pre-defined by the researcher. It usually involves a large number of cards, and requires a lot of preliminary work to make sure the content of the cards and the distribution criteria are appropriate.</Description>
        <process>This method varies from a regular card sort by adding the following steps:
1. Development of the distribution axis (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree)
2. Rather than asking the respondent to group them simply, ask them to distribute them along the axis in a normal distribution (few at each end of the scale, and more in the middle).
3. This method assumes you will use statistical analysis to find higher-order clusterings using results from multiple respondents or multiple sessions with the same respondent.</process>

There are new processes in the analytics of focus groups that involve not just qualitative analysis of the data, but also quantitative analysis. The quantification of text and results can be inspected using new software tools, such as CATPAC. It is doubtful that quantitative techniques will replace established qualitative approaches, but can supplement and improve insight gained from qualitative analysis.

It is appropriate to use this quantitative analytic method after one has the data from focus groups. It represents a different way to analyze the findings from focus groups, which are normally qualitative.</Description>

        <Description>A variant of card-sorting in which respondents are given a single criterion (e.g., frequency of use, personal importance, etc.) around which to sort. The responents then sort the cards into categories that make sense to them (e.g., once-a-day, twice-a-day, valuable, not valuable, etc.). Often, this is done repeatedly with the same respondents and cards, so that the respondents sort the cards over several criterion during a session, but focusing on just one for each round of sorting.</Description>

Another form of geographical organization is illustrated by the division of a business into sales by state, county, or city.  Geographical sequencing of ideas is less usable than other methods because of its rigidity; moreover, relatively few topics lend themselves to such organization.</Description>

Another strategy could be using something different in order to avoid the risk of &quot;taking a couple of days to get everyone on the same page&quot;: the task analysis grid is an interesting alternative to the standard requirements documents.</Description>

        <process>1. Before the meeting, decide on topic for discussion. Draw a large scale profile of a person and draw four arrows coming out of the top of the head. Label those arrows &quot;Know/Know&quot;, &quot;Know/Don&apos;t Know&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t Know/Know&quot; and &apos;Don&apos;t Know/Know&quot; and &quot;Don’t Know/Don&apos;t Know&quot;
2. Give the players access to sticky notes and markers and tell them that the purpose of this game is to try to make explicit the knowledge they have, and the knowledge they don&apos;t have but could use. 
3. Start with Know/Know category. Elicit from the group all information about the topic that they kno they know. This category should go quickly and generate a lot of cntent. Have players write one bit of knowldge on each sticky  note and place them a cluster in this category. 
4. Then, tackle Know&apos;Don&apos;t Know category. Have players write what they know and place in cluster near this arrow. 
5. Move to Don&apos;t Know/Know. This information could be skills people have that are currently not used to solve problems or untapped resources that have been forgotten. 
6. Last, move to Don&apos;t Know/Don&apos;t Know. The group will be stopped here, possibly indefinitely. This category is where discovery and shared exploration take place. Ask players provocative questions: What does this know that your team doesn&apos;t know it doesn&apos;t know? How can you find ut what you don&apos;t know you don&apos;t know?
7. Ask the group what they can do to proactively address the distinct challenges of each categor. Discuss the insights and &quot;ahas.&quot; Even if the players only revelation is that thy have blind spots, this in itself can be a fruitful discovery. </process>

        <Description>User Panels are regular meetings of service users about the quality of a service or other related topics. They help to identify the concerns and priorities of service users and can lead to the early identification of problems or ideas for improvements.

User Panels usually take the form of a workshop and it is important to outline a clear purpose and the time required for participants&apos; involvement right from the beginning. 

Context: 
You should use User Panels when:
 
• You are working with people who are not usually heard, for example those with learning disabilities, children, and the elderly
• You want to establish a two-way dialogue between service providers and users,
•  You want to set up a sounding board for new approaches or proposals relating to services
• As a way of identifying emerging problems</Description>

        <Notes>Benefits of the method:
• Changes can be tracked over time
• Solution focused
• The Panel members are well informed on the issues

Deficit of the method: 
• Time consuming/long-term commitment
• The Panel is not necessarily representative
• A small number of people may dominate the group
• May not take into account relevant needs of non-users of services
• The panels will not deliver statistical information</Notes>

        <Description>Web forums are online communities that focus on a shared interest or experience. If a web forum exists that is relevant to the designer’s interest, specific questions can be posted online for the community to discuss and respond to (either directly to the designer or publicly to the forum). In addition, the designer may find general insights from reading existing and archived posts. This method provides a relatively quick way of talking to a wide number of people and can be very useful in gaining a contextual view of a particular topic. Web forums can also be used to post information regarding more detailed surveys and questionnaires. Permission should always be sought from the forum administrator when joining a web forum for professional purposes.

        <Description>&quot;A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in functionality, behavior, and priority of content.[3] In other words, it focuses on what a screen does, not what it looks like. Wireframes can be pencil drawings or sketches on a whiteboard, or they can be produced by means of a broad array of free or commercial software applications.&quot;</Description>

        <Notes>Benefit of the method: 
• It is good at generating ideas, sharing knowledge, stimulate innovative thinking, and exploring action in real life situations.
• The World Cafe process can deliver new thinking, meaningful conversations, an inclusive and relaxed atmosphere and deeper relationships and mutual ownership of outcomes in an existing group.
• The process can give a group a sense of their own intelligence and insight that is larger than the sum of the parts.

Deficit of the method: 
• Requires a clear and relevant question.
• The World Cafe process cannot deliver clear and accountable direct decisions, detailed plans or a statistical view of different opinions.</Notes>
        <process>1. Develop questions. The choice of question(s) for the cafe conversation is crucial for the success of your event. In general it is useful to phrase the questions in a positive format and in an open ended format to allow a constructive discussion. If participants do not find the questions for discussion inspiring the event is unlikely to be successful, it can therefore be good to develop the question together with some of the intended participants.

2. Choose a café setting. The event either takes place in an actual cafe or else the room is set up to resemble one as much as possible: participants are seated around small tables with tablecloths and tea, coffee and other beverages. The cafe ambiance allows for a more relaxed and open conversation to take place. Often participants are provided with pens and are encouraged to draw and record their conversations on the paper tablecloths to capture free flowing ideas as they emerge.
 
3. Participants discuss the issue at hand around their table and at regular intervals they move to a new table. One participant (the table host) remains and summarises the previous conversation to the newly arrived participants. By moving participants around the room the conversations at each table are cross-fertilised with ideas from other tables.

4. At the end of the process the main ideas are summarised in a plenary session and follow-up possibilities are discussed.</process>

        <Description>Action Learning is a process for bringing together a group of people with varied levels of skills and experience to analyze an actual organizational/community/work problem and develop an action plan (see: Action Planning). In action learning, each participant studies their own actions and experiences in order to help learn more, solve problems and improve performance. This is close to the idea of &apos;learning-by-doing&apos; or teaching by examples. Reginald Revans formulated the process as L=P+Q. This is: Learning = Programming (programmed knowledge or simulations) + Questioning (to create insight for and by others).

Traditional problem solving skills stem from programmed knowledge, that which is already known. However, when faced with more complex issues that have no easy solution it is important to use questioning insight. Through the combination of programmed knowledge and questioning insight (P+Q), participants collectively reflect on problems and are encouraged to think creatively about solutions (L). Here, the varying skills and expertise of participants are adopted as resources and together, solutions are sought.

Action learning is useful for addressing complex problems, to find solutions to underlying root causes of problems, and to determine a new strategic direction or to maximize new opportunities.</Description>
        <Notes>Benefits of Method: 
-Collaborative
-Engages with participants instead of keeping them passive
-Can help change old, inflexible teaching methods
-Provides strong stimulus for self-directed learning
-Learn new problem solving methods from others
-Fosters creative thinking and learning

Deficits of Method:
-Organizing meetings can be difficult
-Meetings may be dominated by individuals
-Can be repetitive</Notes>

        <process>1. Identify the product or process you are dissatisfied with or wish to improve.
2. List its attributes. For a simple physical object like a pen, this might include: Material, Shape, Target market, Colours, Textures, etc.
3. Choose, say, 7-8 of these attributes that seem particularly interesting or important.
4. Identify alternative ways to achieve each attribute (e.g. different shapes: cylindrical cubic, multi-faceted….), either by conventional enquiry, or via any idea-generating technique.
5. Combine one or more of these alternative ways of achieving the required attributes, and see if you can come up with a new approach to the product or process you were working on.</process>
        <Description>This technique breaks an existing product or system down into its component parts, and then explores different ways of modifying or replacing each part for the same or better effect, with the goal of recombining the parts into a new forms of the system. Attributes are those different categories into which the physical, psychological and social characteristics of things can be placed. By listing attributes, you gain both general and specific views of the &quot;&quot;world&quot;&quot; of that subject. Unfortunately,  it&apos;s not clear how to deal with all the permutations this method would create. However, it&apos;s similar to later techniques such as Morphological Analysis.</Description>
