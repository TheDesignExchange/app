3-12-3 Brainstorm	This format for brainstorming compresses the essentials of an ideation session into one short format. The number 3-12-3 refer to the amount of time in minutes given to each of three activities: 3 minutes for generating pool of observations	 12 for combining those observations into rough concepts	 and 3 again for presenting the concepts back to a group. Essential to this format is strict time keeping. 	"1. Pick a topic on which to brainstorm ideas, boiled down to 2 words. 
2. The 2 words can be presented as a full challenge question, such as ""How will tomorrow's television work?"" it is best to avoid doing this right away. By focusing on 2 wors that signify the topic, you will aim to evoke thinking about its defining aspects first, before moving into new concepts or proposing solutions.
3. To set up the game distribute stack of cards and markers to participants. Everyone should have same umber of cards and  distribution should happen after rules are given. 

4. First 3 minutes: Generate a pool of aspects: think about characteristics of the topic and wrie them down on the index card
5. 12 Minutes: Develop concepts: divide group into pairs. each team draws 3 cards randomly from the pool. Teams develop concepts from the chosen cards.
6. 3 minutes: Make presentations: when teams present to the larger group, teams may reveal the cards that they drew and how the cards influenced their thinking.

7Ps Framework	"Every meeting deserves a plan. Note that a great plan can't guarantee  a great outcome, but it will help lay down the fundamentals from which you can adapt. Sketch out these fundamentals by using the 7ps: Purpose, product, people, process,pitfalls, prep, practical. 

Context: Purpose, product, people, process,pitfalls, prep, practical. "	"When preparing for a meeting, thinking through the 7Ps can improve focus and results, even if you have only a few moments to reflect on them. 
Purpose: Consider the urgency of the metting; whats going on and whats on fire? If this is difficult to articulate, ask yourself if a meeting is really necessary
2. Product: What specific artifact will we produce out of the meeting? What will it do and how will it serve the purpose?
3. People: Who needs to be there, and what role will they play? 
4. Process: What agenda will these people use to create the product? Of all the 7Ps, the agenda is where you have the most opportunity to collaborate in advance
5. Pitfalls: What are the risks of the meeting, and how will they be addressed? 
6. Prep: What would be useful to do in advance? This could be material to rad in advancem research to conduct, or homework to assign to the attendees
7. Practical concerns: These are the logistics of the meeting--the where and when and importantly, who's bringing lunch"	"Each of the 7Ps can influence or change one of the others, and developing a good plan will take this into account 

The 7Ps can give you a framework for designing a meeting, but they can't run the meeting for you. The unexpected will happen, and as a leader you will need to adapt. "	pg 54	Gathering information		credited to James Macanufo																						
Action Learning	"Action learning is a process whereby the participant studies their own actions and experience in order to help learn more, solve problems and improve performance. This is close to the idea of 'learning-by-doing' or teaching by examples.

Reginald Revans formulated the process as L=P+Q. This is Learning = Programming (programmed knowledge or simulations) + Questioning (to create insight for and by others).

Action learning should be used to address complex problems, to find solutions to underlying root causes of problems, and to determine a new strategic direction or to maximize new opportunities. "	"Participants consist of small groups representative of a given society with various skills and areas of expertise.

Participants meet for sets of 1-2 hour or more.

1. Clarify the objective of the Action Learning groups
2. Convene a cross-section of people with complementary skills and expertise to participate
3. Hold initial meetings to analyze the issues and identify actions for resolving them
4. Take action in the work place
5. Use subgroups to work on the specific aspects of the problem if necessary
6. Reconvene the group after a period of time to discuss progress/lessons leanred/future action

"	"An effective action plan should give a definite timetable and set of clearly defined steps to help you to reach your objective. For each objective there should be a separate action plan.

1. Identify your objectives
2. Set objectives that are achievable and measurable

Action Research	"In Action Research the researcher typically tries to provide a service to a research ""client"", often an organization, and at the same time add to the body of knowledge in a particular domain. In technology-related inquiry, an Action Research study could entail the researcher introducing a new technology in an organization, and at the same time studying the effects of the technology in that organization. "	"Action Research Procedure is a cycle of five stages:
1. Diagnosing: Identifying or defining a problem
2. Action Planning: Consider alternative courses of action
3. Taking Action: Selecting a course of action
4. Evaluating: Studying the consequences of an action
5. Specficying Learning: Identifying general findings"	"Six key principles:
1. Reflective Critique
The principle of reflective critique ensures people reflect on issues and processes and make explicit the interpretations, biases, assumptions and concerns upon which judgments are made.  In this way, practical accounts can give rise to theoretical considerations.

2. Dialectical critique
Dialectical critique is required to understand the set of relationships both between the phenomenon and its context, and between the elements constituting the phenomenon.  The key elements to focus attention on are those constituent elements that are unstable, or in opposition to one another.  These are the ones that are most likely to create changes.

3. Collaborative Resource 
The principle of collaborative resource presupposes that each person’s ideas are equally significant as potential resources for creating interpretive categories of analysis, negotiated among the participants.  It strives to avoid the skewing of credibility stemming from the prior status of an idea-holder.  It especially makes possible the insights gleaned from noting the contradictions both between many viewpoints and within a single viewpoint

4. Risk
Initiators of action research will use this principle to allay others’ fears and invite participation by pointing out that they, too, will be subject to the same process, and that whatever the outcome, learning will take place.

5.Plural Structure
This plural structure of inquiry requires a plural text for reporting.  This means that there will be many accounts made explicit, with commentaries on their contradictions, and a range of options for action presented.

6. Theory, Practice, Transformation
For action researchers, theory informs practice, practice refines theory, in a continuous transformation."	"http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/action_research.html

Active Listening	"Active listening is a specific communication skill, based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, which involves giving free and undivided attention to the speaker. Knights defines free attention as: ‘... placing all of one’s attention and awareness at the disposal of another person, listening with interest and appreciating without interrupting.’ 

The purpose of Active Listening is to achieve a greater understanding of what the listener is trying to convey. 

In design, Active Listening is especially useful when conducting interviews. "	"Active Listening Skills:

Attentive body language
- Posture and gestures showing involvement and engagement
-Appropriate body movement
-Appropriate facial expressions
-Appropriate eye contact
- Nondistracting environment

Following Skills (Giving the speaker space to tell their story their own way)
- Interested 'door openers'
- Minimal verbal encouragers
- Infrequent, timely and considered questions
- Attentive silences
Reflecting Skills (restating the feeling and/or content with understanding and acceptance)
- Paraphrase (check periodically that you've understood)
- Reflect back feelings and content
- Summarize the major issues"	"Related Methods: Interviews, Expert interviews, Extreme User Interviews, Dyad Interviews, Pre-Interviews, Structures Interviews, Triad Interviews, Photo-elicitation interviews

As Carl Rogers said in 1980: ‘Attentive listening means giving one’s total and undivided attention to the other person and tells the other that we are interested and concerned. Listening is difficult work that we will not undertake unless we have deep respect and care for the other... we listen not only with our ears, but with our eyes, mind, heart and imagination, as well. We listen to what is going on within ourselves, as well as to what is taking place in the person we are hearing. We listen to the words of the other, but we also listen to the messages buried in the words. We listen to the voice, the appearance, and the body language of the other... We simply try to absorb ever ything the speaker is saying verbally and nonverbally without adding, subtracting, or amending’."	"Robertson K (2005). Active listening: more than just paying attention.

1. Activity Map - identifies relevant activities and their interrelationships
2. Activity Profiles - describes the salient aspects of relevant activities
3. Participation Map - shows involvement of actors with the system, with other artifacts, and with other participants"	"An Activity Model defines and describes activities and their interrelationships. Roles and tasks are explicity connected to the activities in which they are imbedded.

Atomize	This exercise starts with a single item and ends with a layer-by-layer analysis of its components. It is useful for unpacking large but poorly understood structures.	" 1. Open the exercise by putting the name of the system on a sticky note at the top of a large whiteboard. Introduce the exercise as a way to understand what the system is made of in tangible terms, by breaking it down into its atoms. 2. To start the brainstorming, ask the group to ""split"" the main system into its components. In this step you are generating a list of things to capture on sticky notes directly below the main topic. Generally, a short list of three to five large components is the norm. 3. For each item, repeat the splitting process by asking ""What combines to create this?""

Attitude Questionnaire/Subjective Assessment	"Subjective assessment tells the evaluator how the users feel about the software being tested. This is distinct from how efficiently or effectively they perform with the software.

1. Identify the questionnaire you will use. 
2. Ensure that all your targeted population has been given a questionnaire to fill out. 

If you are doing a mail-shot, expect approximately 20% response rate. This may be higher if you are doing it via the web. You can increase your response rate to nearly 100% by doing reminder personal calls. 

If you are using the questionnaire as part of a lab test, ensure that the questionnaires as filled out can be associated with all the other data (time scores, tapes, sample outputs etc.) from the respondents - so you don’t have questionnaires which you cannot match up with the rest of the data.

It is usual not to prompt the respondent how to reply. If a respondent complains that a question is inapplicable or wrong, tell them words to the effect that it is up to them to make their own judgement about each question, and that there are no right or wrong answers. Encourage them not to miss out questions.

Canonical Abstract Prototyping	"Canonical Abstract Prototyping is an extension to user-centered design that provides a formal vocabulary for expressing visual and interaction design without concern for details of apperance and behavior. The ultimate result of the abstract prototyping process is a complete but abstract provisional design for the entire user interface. Such an abstract prototype can be validated against the task model by walking through task cases or scenarios to verify that tasks can be performed with reasonable efficiency given the tools and materials available.

Canonical Abstract Prototyping is appropriate when attempting to take a task model and create a complete yet abstract conceptual design for the entire user interface. This makes generating a realistic model more straightforward."	"To generate the canonical abstract model from a task model:
1. For each cluster of closely related task cases, an interaction context is provisionally defined. For each task case in a cluster, the defining dialog or narrative is examined.
2. For each step in the narrative, the interface contents necessary for performance of the step are identified and appropriate abstract tools and materials are added to the contents of the interaction context. In practice, this is often accomplished using sticky notes to represent abstract components
3. Where specialized Canonical Abstract Components are clearly needed or preferred, these are used; otherwise, generic tools, materials, or combinations are used. Canonical Abstract Components model the various interactive functions–such as interrupting an action or displaying a collection of information–needed within the realized user interface.
4. Once all the necessary tools and materials have been incorporated into the interaction context, the layout and organization of the interaction context are explored. Area is allocated based on such things as importance, complexity, and user focus.
5. Abstract Components are positioned according to such issues as workflow and conceptual or semantic interrelationships and may be by combined into composite components when meaningful and potentially useful."	"Canonical Abstract Prototypes emerged from a workshop of practitioners convened in 2000 by Constantine & Lockwood, Ltd.

Furthermore, Card Sorting can be used towards the end of the design process as well to check and perhaps correct and/or enhance the product to meet the users' preferences and values."	"In Single-Criterion sorting, the respondents are given a criterion by the designers (e.g. with cards representing the various applications on a phone, the category could be frequency of use). The respondents then sort the cards into categories (e.g. once a day, twice a day, etc. for the phone applications example). Analysis after various categorizations over different criteria eventually allows designers to understand which features are most important and/or useful to consumers.

Tips: Design team needs to sort cards in ways that make sense to them. "	"Benefits of the method: The users can utilize all their senses when investigating the cards allowing them to possibly create new categories of sorting that may not have appeared before.

Deficits of the method: 
Often times, the objects can have strange and/or unwanted relationships that skew the sorting away from the intended categories and perspectives. Furthermore, the sorting can only address ""static, flat, [and] explicit knowledge,"" rather than providing more tacit knowledge about structured relationships.

CARD Technique	"The CARD (Collaborative Analysis of Requirement and Design) technique essentially creates cards that explain the results of the discussions, all of which can be used for more formal analytical techniques. This method is used to help the Design Team's members better understand each other's backgrounds and work history, as well as brainstorm innovations to improve the current design process. 

CARD sorting is best used in the very beginning of the design process when design teams are first created."	"A typical CARD session progresses as follows:
1. Introducing People - Team members introduce their names, workplace group interests, etc.
2. Introducing Materials - Each person fills out his/her card with an activity or component of an activity that could occur in the workplace.
3. Work of the Session - The team engages in three sessions of deep involvement:
- Participatory Analysis - Each user describes his or her work and the other members ask questions
- Participatory Design - The entire team discusses a user's work and/or possible innovations in work practice and technologies.
- Participatory Assessment - The entire team collectively critiques a specific work practice."	"The first documented usage of CARD Technique was that of the studies in the work of U S West telephone companies during 1993-1996 Cards for the CARD sessions were based off of the training materials required of the components of the work, and included activities such as ""customers' requests and clarifications, operators' work with keyboard and screen,"" etc.

Character Profile	"The character profiles is a tool for the creation of a shared knowledgeabout the service users inside the team. In order to build these character profiles it’s required the identification of some significant fictitious characters and then the collecting of an image and a textual description for each one of them.
The character profiles offer a clear and visible picture of the different kinds of users that are the centre of the design activities.

This method should be used in the design phase process when trying to learn about the user and how he/she interacts with his/her environment."	Character Profiling involves gathering data based on observations to develop character profiles that represent archetypes and the details of their behavior or lifestyl.e		http://servicedesigntools.org/tools/6	"Generating Ideas and Concepts

Citizen Advisory Groups	"Advisory groups can take many different forms depending on the exact purpose of the group. 
The group needs to have access to relevant information and may meet either over a couple of days as a one-off event, or regularly over a longer period."	"Tips:
1. Find the right people: Bring on those most affected first, then those who are generally interested, and then fill in any missing areas of expertise.
2.  Get the group organized: Develop a clear goal, keep members focused on choices, and highlight underlying values of the issues.
3. Give them the problem—and stand behind their decision(s) or product(s).
4. Make everyone’s role clear: Maintain the focus and let the citizens make the choices.

Citizen Summits	"Citizens' Summits are deliberative meetings involving large numbers of people (typically between 500-5000) and using communication technology to facilitate discussions.
"	"1. The event is structured on work sessions which correspond to the main themes on the public agenda: finding solutions, prioritizing the solution on the main target groups and the selection of the best solutions. 
2. The participants are organized in groups which are moderated by sociologist. 
3. The debates are conceived in sequences, using the focus group methodology and are integrated by the simultaneous votes they receive at the end of each session."	"The technology, which includes electronic voting, text messages, and online surveys, makes it possible to engage large numbers of people in the same place, at the same time. Citizens' summits trace their background to 21st Century Town Meetings and the work of AmericaSpeaks in the USA.

The advantage of a public debate is that it brings the local authorities closer to the citizens and the latter closer to the decision making process, increasing thus their involvement in the community. It is an event that catches the mass media's eye, that is easily disseminated and benefits from a modern methodology which offers the best ratio in terms of information, time and costs.

Citizen’s Jury	"Citizens' juries consist of a small panel of non-specialists, modelled on the structure of a criminal jury. The group set out to examine an issue of public significance in detail and deliver a ""verdict"". 

Citizens Juries are often used around current, often controversial, public policy issues where opinion is sharply divided and policy makers cannot decide what to do."	"1. The ""jury"" is made up of people who are usually selected ""at random"" from a local or national population, with the selection process open to outside scrutiny.
2. The jurors cross-question expert ""witnesses"" — specialists they have called to provide different perspectives on the topic — and collectively produce a summary of their conclusions, typically in a short report.
3. The whole process is supervised by an oversight or advisory panel composed of a range of people with relevant knowledge and a possible interest in the outcome. They take no direct part in facilitating the citizens' jury. Members of this group subsequently decide whether to respond to, or act on, elements of this report."

Classic Ethnography	This method can be used to gain a descriptive understanding of potential customers in settings in which the new product will be employed. This method can also be used to observe and analyze consumers interactions with the products. Through Classic Ethnography	 the designer will gain self-refexictiy through participant observation and an encompassing understanding of subjects' interactions with objects within environment as a whole. 	"There is no agreed upon set of principles that guide an ethnographical approach to design; however, the overarching activities include:
1. Observation and detaile ddescription of the observed subjects in natural settings
2. And, more importantly, analysis of those observations
3. Using analysis, create narratives and identify patterns to develop a model of the product user's experience"	"Similar Methods: ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, activity theory and observation of ""activity systems"", customer surveys, operability assessments, focus groups, field trips
Note: differences between ethnography and traditional methods is that traditional methods, with the exception of field trips, take the user out of the natural setting. The focus is largely on the acceptability of a product rather than the relationship between the user and the product. Ethnography provides a higher chance for the designer to incorporate users' desires.

Blomberg emphasizes guiding principles when applying ethnography to design research so as to maintain the method's authenticity:
Natural Settings: Research and observations must be conducted in field settings rather than in laboratories
Holism: Behaviors must be understood in everyday contexts, how they fit into larger society
Descriptive: Descriptive understanding derives from how people actually behave versus how they ought to; non-judgmental
Members' Point of View: Must situate oneself in point of view of the observed

First applied to product design in the 1980s when traditional view that technologies supported individual tasks shifted to view that technologies should assist collaboration and cooperation among people. (Blomberg) New field developed: Computer Support for Cooperative Work (also, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) (CSCW) to design computer software and tooks for group work. Anthropologists, using ethnographic processes, examined everyday practices of computer users. Found large discrepancy between software programmer's intuition for how intended users would use programs and how consumers actually used them.

Close-Ended Questions	"Close-ended Questions are questions that are used to clarify facts, and their responses can be answered with an easy ""yes"" or ""no."" Close-ended questions should be used in interviews to clarify confusion or verify information, and they should be balanced with Open-ended Questions. "	"Guidelines:
Know the difference between an open-ended question and a close-ended question. In doing so:
-Change your tactics
- Change the way you phrase your words order to get your respondents to talk
- Try asking more general questionsl that way, you might get a longer and fuller resonse that contains the information that you're looking for 
Follow up wit ""WHY?"" and ""HOW?"" if you ask close-ended question to get a fuller reponse
Go narrow first then rboad and open
- This suggestion should be used to get your respondent to talk If they aren't comfortable talking, narrow down the questions, anda fter they start conversing, broaden them  
Listen
- Make sure that you listen to your respondents
- This ensures that you don't miss an opportunity for any follow up questions 

E.g.) Do you get along with your roommate? "	"Benefits of Method: 
-May be less threatening to the respondent because there is some degree of anonymity
-Easy to answer

Deficits of Method: 
-Forces respondents to choose among categories
-Hypothesized that respondents want to conform to social desirability; therefore, respondents are reluctant to choose extreme responses
-Offers incomplete responses

The evaluators may include human factors engineers	 software developers	 or people from marketing	 documentation	 etc. This technique is best used in the design stage of development. But it can also be applied during the code	 test	 and deployment stages.	"Defining the Input to the Walkthrough:
1. Who will be the users of the system? 
2. What task(s) will be analyzed? 
3. What is the correct action sequence for each task?

Collaborative Authoring in Wikis	"Wiki is a tool used by many to author a document together. This method includes working together to achieve collective results that the participants would be incapable of accomplishing working online. Because of the nature of a wiki to combine all knowledge into one space, users can expect to be more informed after visiting a wiki.

In addition, summarizing a topic and addressing important information is a learning experience of its own. The ability to explain a topic in written form requires a sufficient understanding of the topic alone. 

Dandelion is an extension from Wiki. It is built to support coordinated, collaborative authoring in wikis with a tag-based function that allows specification of co-authoring tasks.  

Dandelion is better at supporting more structured collaborative document authoring, where the role of a coordinator is clear and the document outline is known"	To edit a wiki's node	 click on the 'Edit page' and input relevant information.	"Benefits of this method:
- Easy to use
- Leaders can know about the peer's status of a working document
- Monitor co-authoring tasks
- Collaborative contribution to a topic gives all involved a sense of community as well as responsibility. Users can feel that they are unified in a cause to inform as well as take ownership of what they contribute. A log that keeps information on which users input information adds to the sense of responsibility and accountability.

Deficits of this method:
- Conflicting opinions between coordinators and design participants as the Dandelion was used
- Disclosing unfinished products
- Reminder feature
-Due to the nature of collaborative sharing, information needs to be consistently checked for validity

Componential Analysis	"Componential analyis is the systematic search for the attributes (components of meaning) associated with cultural categories. Whenever an ethnographer discovers contrasts among the members of a domain, these contrasts are best thought of as attributes or components of meaning.

The purpose of Componential Analysis is to organize and represent contrasts discovered through ethnographies and taxonomies.

This method of organizing information should be used with ethnographic research, specifically with the methods of Participant Observation and Taxonomies"	"1. Select a domain for analysis
2. Inventory all contrasts previously discovered - Possibly start  with notes complied from asking contrast questions and/or making selective observations. (e.g. Aremnian Catholics speak Armenian as a first language; Shunni speak Arabic as a first language.)
3. Prepare a paradigm worksheet - consists of an empty paradigm in which you enter the cultural categories of the domain down the lefthand column, while making notes about the relationships between the paradigm and the other domains.
4. Identify dimensions of contrast that have binary values - A dimension of contrast is an idea or concept that has at least two parts, although in this case it specifically has two parts since the values must be binary. (e.g. If you were analyzing the domain ""kinds of trees,"" you would come up with one dimension of contrast that might be stated ""characterized by the presence of leaves."" This is a dimension of contrast related to trees and has two values or parts: ""yes"" or ""no."")
5. Combine closely related dimensions of contrast into ones that have multipe values - Instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" dimensions of contrast, add more complex ones such as ""First language,"" providing more qualitative information.
6. Prepare contrast questions for missing attributes
7. Conduct selective observations to discover missing information
8. Prepare a completed paradigm - This final paradigm can be used as a chart in ethnographic research."	"Related Methods: Classic Ethnography, Rapid Ethnography, Quick and Dirty Ethnography, Participant Observation, Taxonomies

Componential Analysis has been most frequently used to breakdown the meanings of somewhat related words with particular emphasis placed on kinship analysis words (eg: brother, mother, aunt) and their translation between languages. For example, one could compare the terms sister and brother and find that these terms are parallel in the sense that both are children of the same parent but will find that the words differ in gender identified.

Concept Mapping	"Concept mapping is a process that involves the identification of concepts in study materials and their organization from the most to the least general, more specific concepts (Novak, 1981, p. 3). The usage of concept mapping prevents mistakenly omitting important material as well as highlight the necessity of understanding how concepts relate to each other in a logical manner.

CM as a tool for designing  structuring curricula; also for helping students better retain information. Concept mapping can be utilized in multiple ways including: lesson planning, study guides, and tutorial outlines."	"1. Identify a particular activity or topic with a desire to understand more completely. It is most effective to clearly define the range of the topic so as keep the map contained and focused. Writing a Focus Question is a good way to define the domain of the map.
2. Designate the key concepts that are within this domain. A possible approach is to list the concepts and rank the concepts from most general to most specific.
3. Begin the concept map by placing all concepts in a space where they can easily be shifted. A good method to placing concepts in the map is to organize them by those with similar ranking and those that are easily relatable.
4.  Then create links between concepts in sub-domains. These links may contain specific words or phrases that clearly connect the concepts in order to clearly indicate their relationship.
5. A concept map requires continuous editing as new comprehension is introduced

Ultimately, concept mapping will result in a chart of ideas and their relationships to one another. This form of structuring topics enables the creator to visually understand and review how an overall Focus Question can be broken down into relevant sub-domains of important related concepts.
"	"Benefits of Method:
Research shows that concept mapping helps in gaining better and more comprehensive understanding of the learning material.
The usage of concept mapping prevents mistakenly omitting important material as well as highlight the necessity of understanding how concepts relate to each other in a logical manner.

Deficits of Method: 
Concept Mapping can be time consuming to prepare. 
When teachers review students’ concept maps, judging the correctness of the map may be difficult. 
While it may be clear that some relationships are faulty, the overall structuring of the map is subjective. Therefore, it may be hard to determine where exactly a weakness in comprehension may exist. "	"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.137.2955rep=rep1type=pdf

Conjoint Techniques	"Conjoint analysis allows researchers to establish how much consumers value individual features of products or services.

Conjoint analysis can be used after there is a final product and a marketing strategy wants to be developed; which features to emphasize and what price to sell it at. It can also be used to determine what specific features and combination of features consumers find to be most important before designing a product."	"1. Conjoint analysis asks people to rate combinations of features, or to choose between two or more combinations. This forces them to make trade-off decisions which is closer to how they make choices in real life.
2. Analysis of the ratings allocates a value to each feature and to each of the options from which it is possible to estimate the value of any combination of these elements.
3. Simple conjoint analysis can be carried out by telephone or face-to-face interview. More complex problems may call for a computer-driven interview."	"Benefits of this method: Simulates the trade-off decisions that consumers make in real life

Related Methods: Interviews, Direct Observation, Focus Groups

Conjoint analysis was popularised as a tool for the practical analysis of rank order consumer judgment data by Green and Rao (1971) and Green and Wind (1973).

The theory that underlies the design and analysis of rank-order judgment experiments was developed by several writers (for example, Luce and Tukey, 1964; Kruskal, 1965; Tversky, 1967), and is summarised in Krantz et al, (1971)."	"Comber, Miriam. The Methods Lab: Conjoint Techniques.

Content Models	"Content models can be used in a variety of ways depending on the level of abstraction and simplicity. Content inventories, the most simple and abstract form, consist of simple lists inventorying the information and controls to be collected within a given interaction context.

Content models are appropriate during the prototype generation phase of the design process, when the design is still in more abstract forms. They serve as an appropriate lead-in to resolving detailed design decisions"	"1. Serve as an intermediate bridge between task models and realistic designs, smoothing, simplifying, and systematizing the design process.
2. Encourage reasoning and experimentation with how component parts of a user interface are combined and distributed to form a coherent, understandable, and usable whole.

After forming content models, the designer will have a user interface prototype with basic information, controls and form of organization that can be used for experimentation to promote the generation of a detailed user interface design."	"Benefits of Method:
-Facilitates problem solving in interface organization, navigation or overall structure without specific details.

Deficits of Method: 
-Lacks the ability to help resolve detail design decisions in layout, visual presentation, and component selection, as well as fine points in interaction design and interface behavior

Context use of Analysis	"Context of Use (CoU) analysis is a generic technique that assists development by posing certain probe questions about the project. The probe questions elicit from the development team and other stakeholders in the project information that may be held 'below the surface' by one or more of the constituent groups.

Questions asked deal with the following three issues:
1. Who will use the software?
2. What will they do w the software?
3. Where will they use the software?"	"A good way to collect the information is to arrange a half-day meeting. Invite stakeholders who have knowledge about the intended users and usage. Suggested people involved:
- project manager
- user representative(s
- developer(s)
- training
- support

A the meeting, discuss and fill in each item on the context checklist. Try to obtain consensus where there is uncertainty or disagreement. If information is missing, agree how this can be obtained. Avoid prolonged discussion of minor issues.


After the meeting obtain any missing information. If the information is not easily available, arrange a field study to observe users in their work environment."	"Benefits of the method: 
Ensure that all factors that relate to use of the system are identified before design work starts.

Provide a basis for designing later usability tests

Contextual Design 	Contextual Design refers to a customer-centric approach to design where customer data forms the foundation for what a system does and how it is structured. It means working from customer data to design implications to specific features	 a process fueled by the customer's needs	 not technology's mandates. 	"
1. Contextual Inquiry: One-on-one interaction with people in the work place, while they work. Team interpretation sessions, where each member of the team puts their own perspective to bear on the data. This produces a shared understanding of the customer.
2. Work Modeling: Work models are created during the interpretation sessions introduced above. These work models take one of five forms, and allow a concrete, visual representation of the work that each interviewed customer engages in.
3. Consolidation: In this stage the team finds the common structure of the customers' work, bringing the many details together to produce a cohesive pattern. A single picture of the population is made explicit. This part of the CD process uses two tools: affinity diagrams and work models. Affinity diagrams illustrate each detail from each interviewed customer's experience, while work models integrate these details into an overarching picture. This picture then guides the design team in their task.
4. Work Redesign: Work Redesign focuses on the ways that the customers' work experience can be improved-- before any new technology or system is put in place. It takes the vision developed from the Consolidation stage and uses it as a base for any brainstorms of new technologies. Storyboards of how the experience would be different are helpful in this stage.
5. User Environment Design: User Environment Design makes the new system--and the new way of working that this implies--explicit. In this step each part of the new system is tied to the customer's work model, including ""how it supports the user's work, exactly what function is available in that part, and how it connects with other parts of the system"" (Beyer & Holtzblatt 24). This step justifies the new system's many parts, without having to commit and without involving a user interface. With each part of the step made explicit, the team can ensure that the many parts relate to one another and meet the customers' needs. It ensures coherence in the design process, keeping the system focused on the customer data.
6. Mock-Up & Test with Customers: Any system needs to be tested and tweaked before being finalized. This part of the process uses paper prototypes to introduce the initial concept of the design to the customer. This prototyping session with the customer enables the design team to work with the customers and individualize the system to meet their needs. Partnering with the client then spurs a detailed user interface and improved system.
7. Putting into Practice: Implement! The last step is to tailor your design system to the workplace itself."	"

Conversation Cafes	Conversation Cafe is an informal dialogue method which invites people to take part in discussions about topical issues in an informal setting.	"1. Assemble up to 8 people plus host, hearty topic, a talking object, and time (60-90 min.). Host explains process and agreements.
2. Round 1: Pass around the talking object; each person speaks briefly to the topic, no feedback or response.
3. Round 2: Again with talking object, each person deepens their own comments or speaks to what has meaning now.
4. Dialogue: Open, spirited conversation. Use talking object if there is domination, contention, or lack of focus.
5. Final Round: With talking object, each person says briefly what challenged, touched or inspired them."	"Inclusivity: Create an inviting climate in which everyone is inspired to speak and listen, and where diverse perspectives may emerge.
One host at least – everyone able to host at best: Ensure that at least one host is present at each Conversation Café gathering – ideally every table has a host.
Open access: Anyone may participate who follows the “rules” (Process, Agreements and Principles). Conversation Cafés are open to all, without charge.

Coverstory	Game about pure imagination. Purpose is to think expansively around an ideal future state of the organization	 an exercise in visioning. Object of the game is to suspend all disbelief and envision a future state that is so stellar that it landed your organization on the cover of a well-known magazine. The players must pretend as though this future has already taken place and has been reported by the mainstream media. Worth doing this acitivity because it not only encourages people to think big  but also actually plants the seeds for a future that perhaps wasnt possibly before the game was played. 	"1. Before the meeting, draw out large scale templated that include the categories: quotes, images, sidebars, cover, brainstorms, and Big Headlines. The number of templates you create depends on the size of the group. At most, allow four to six people work on one template together. 
2. Explain the object of the game and define each category on the template. 
Cover: tells the Big Story of their success. 
Headlines: convery the substance of the cover story.
Sidebars: reveal interesting facets on the cover story. 
Quotes: can be from anyone as long as they're related to the story
Brainstorm: is for documenting initial ideas for the cover story
Images are for supporting the content with illustrations. 
3. break the players into groups of 4-6 people and make sure there are markers and one template for each group. Tell the players to populate the template they can either select a scibe or write and draw on it together. 
4. Ask the players to imagine best case scenario ofr their company to take that  scenario one step further. write down the story of the year on the template. 
5. Tell groups to stop and ome together to present their visions first. Give each group 5-10 minutes to share what they imagined was written in the story and supporting elements. 
6. Note any common vision themes and areas of agreement. Ask for  observations, insights, and conerns about the future state.

Critical Incident Technique Analysis	"The CIT is a method for getting a subjective report while minimising interference from stereotypical reactions or received opinions. It is an open-ended retrospective method of finding out what users feel are the critical features of the software being evaluated. 
"	"End users are asked to identify specific incidents which they experienced personally and which had an important effect on the final outcome. The emphasis is on incidents rather than vague opinions. 

The context of the incident may also be elicited. Data from many users is collected and analysed."	"Benefits of the method: 
-More flexible than a questionnaire or survey and is recommended in situations where the only alternative is to develop a questionnaire or survey from the start. It focuses on user behaviour, so it can be used in situations where video recording is not practicable so long as the inherent bias of retrospective judgement is understood.

Cultural Probes	"Cultural Probes are used to insight inspirational responses about the daily life and habits of communities in a naturally engaging way. It serves as a means of gathering inspirational data about people's lives, values and thoughts.

This method should be used for qualitative anecdotes and not for qualitative results."	"1. Identify the group to study and introduce this method as a way to learn more about their life practices or whatever the particular type of interaction is of interest. The researchers found that a personal visit made the subjects much more connected and enthusiastic about the process than simply mailing the package with instructions.
2. Assemble and deliver the packages. Included are postcards, maps, a camera etc. See below for the specific list of items in the package.
3. Stay in contact with the subjects while they fill out the information in their packages and complete the assignments. This means that between the one week to a month time period that the subjects will be mailing back your materials, answer any questions that they might have and encourage them in their process.
4. Receive the packages of completed assignments back in the mail. This usually takes 1-4 weeks after the subjects receive the probes. Read through and draw out insightful information from the responses. This method is not intended to quantitatively analyzed.
"	"Many points have been taken to make the subject feel more comfortable, at ease, and interested in completing their research assignments than many other methods. Cultural probes allow the subject to be very self directed in their responses which will allow this research to bring out even more about their habits than a lead-questioning method. For example, the personal survey questions are on postcards. The cards are also pre-postmarked to an individual researcher by name, rather than the research firm inc. This helps the subject respond to the given questions in a natural, friendly, and hopefully more insightful manner.

Benefits of the method: 
Subjects feel comfortable and self-directed in their responses

Deficits of Method:
-The return is dependent on the individual completing the work and mailing it in. In some communities there were nearly full responses from the members of the elder community however in others there were less than half responses.
-Lack of quantitate data that can be extracted 
-More time intensive and costly due to the preparation of the materials and the personal visits to the community

Design Charrettes	A Design Charrette is an intensive	 hands-on workshop that brings people from different disciplines and backgrounds together to explore design options for a particular area or site.	For more informaton about how to hold a Design Charrette	 please see: http://www.nrel.gov/sustainable_nrel/pdfs/44051.pdf	"Benefits of this Method: 
- Provide a forum for planning the project with those who can influence design decisions to make sure early decisions avoid missteps—it is easier to set a course than to change it.
-Provide an opportunity for lessons learned from previous projects to inform the planning process.
-Kick off the design process.
-Encourage agreement on project goals.
-Save time and money by collaborating on ideas, issues, and concerns early in the design process to help avoid later iterative redesign activities.
-Promote ""collective enthusiasm"" for a project with early realistic goals and directions."	"http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Design+Charrettes

Design Documentaries	This design method was created to catch everyday life. It is believed that film captures human expressivity and emotion in ways that other purely observational studies cannot. It is also appropriate when all the researchers aren’t able to be “in the field.”	"Design Documentaries: Participatory Research and Design by Bas Raijmakers, outlines the following process:
1. Document what happens during the research on film
2. Select video clips to support analyses
3. Communicate research to a team

There are two general approaches to conduct a film documentary for design purposes:
1. Dialectic, where the filmmaker maintains a perspective of the work they are documenting. Conducting research in this manner encourages discussion over neutral observation of facts. Another form of dialectic can include interviewing the subject after an event to understand their perspective on the situation.
2. Coexistence of Opposites, where a filmmaker is able to demonstrate alternative possibilities between choosing opposite events. This allows a design process to include paradoxes and uncertainties of everyday life."	"This method allows for a better understanding of peoples' wants and needs by making them ""come to life"" through film. This helps the researcher understand the subject's context. This method can inspire new design by observing complexities of everyday life. Since documentaries have an enormous amount of information displayed through video, they enable open ended conclusions and a variety of pptential solutions.

Design Games	Using games during the co-design sessions allows to share the references in order to bridge different points of view: the games provide a common platform for the conversation between all the participants. 	"Example of  Design Game:

1. A base map of a site or room is prepared. 
2. Cut-out pieces representing items that could be incorporated are made to the same scale. Materials for making pieces are kept at hand to allow new items to be made as desired. 
3. Individuals or groups move pieces around until they are happy with the design, which is then photographed. 
4. Layouts produced by different individuals or groups are discussed and analysed as a basis for drawing up sketch designs and costings. 
"	"Instead of the design team holing up to produce some ideas for approval, games can involve a broad spectrum of players, animate their participation and obtain better insights. The games help bring tacit knowledge to the surface by providing tools for articulating the ideas.

The accessibility of design games -especially in terms of rules and languages- has to be guaranteed in order to allow the participation of each individual."	http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/welcomingworkplace/_methods/5_designInterventions.html	"Generating Ideas and Concepts

Design Guidelining	"Guidelines for user interface design summarize good practice and provide useful high and low level guidance on the design of usable interfaces. 
The purpose of this method is to provide for a better-designed interface and a list of any inconsistencies with guidelines."	Adherence to specific guidelines can be specified as part of the usability requirements. Designers and developers should then familiarise themselves with the relevant guidelines	 and expert evaluation should be used to check for compliance with the most important guidelines.		http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/criticalincidents.htm	Generating Ideas and Concepts																							
Design Probe	"The purpose of the Design Probe is to obtain self-disclosed insights into people’s lives.
This method is most appropriate for  the early explore-and-focus stages of the design process"	"A research kit is prepared by the designer and given to users to record aspects of their lives autonomously, independent of the designer.

The design probe may include diaries, question cards, postcards, disposable cameras or other tools for mapping and drawing. Design probes may be personalised for a specific user, who is given tasks to undertake, or the same probes may be given to a selection of users. Probes can be placed in an environment to collect information more generally from users of that space. Design probes are also known as cultural probes or user diaries."

Design-in-Context	Use Design-in-Context in the beginning of the design phase. This method can be used in contexts of defined boundaries - such as in a factory. Is also very useful to test prototypes and observe how the user interacts and relates to the new product.	"Werner Sperschneider & Kirsten Bagger's article on ""Ethnographic fieldwork under industrial constraints"" outlines a method called Design-in-Context that uses Participant Observation to acquire data on design:
1. Situated Interview: ""Tell me what you do""; qualitative interview techniques 
2. Simulated Use: ""Show me how you do it""; obsesrve simulated use
3. Acting Out: ""Show me your normal procedure""; observe work routines
4. Shadowing: ""Let me walk with you""; follow users in daily routine
5. Apprenticeship: ""Teach me how""; designer steps into user's role and draw insider perspective

2. Select participants
3. Instruct participants on how to use diary:
- Feedback studies: participants answer pre-defined questions about the events
- Elicitation studies: participants record media and interview discussions are structured according to the captured media
4. Look for patterns and insight"	"Benefits of Method:
-Less memory lapses and retrospective messaging since period between event occurrence and recording is short

Dot Voting	This process takes place when there are too many ideas developed through the brainstorming phase. Dot voting is one of the simplest ways to prioritize and converge upon an agreed solution. It could be used to hone a list of features	 to agree on discussion topics	 or to choose amng strategies and concepts.	"First, the group needs to set a things to vote on. This may be something they have just developed, such as a wall of sticky notes, or it may be flip-chart list that captures the ideas in one place. Ask the group to cast their votes by placing a dot next to the items they feel strongly about. Participants have 5 votes to cast and may vote more than once for a single topic. 

2. Once all votes are cast, tally them, and if necessary, make a list of the items by their new rank. 

3. This prioritized listr becomes the subject of discussion and decision making. in some cases, it may be useful to reflect on ideas that didn't receive votes to verify that they haven't been left behind without a cause. 
"	"This technique is used to collaboratively prioritize any set of items. Giving participants 5 votes is enough to be meaninful while still asking for individual prioritization; however, this is not a hard rule.

Dramaturgy	"Dramaturgy consists of combining user-centered design and drama methods to study a specific user group with the purpose of allowing designers to effectively empathize and understand the users needs and concerns. Dramaturgy aims to develop a set of design tools that simultaneously reveal user experience and group dynamics and to help designers empathize with user needs and more dynamically understand the user's universe, goals, hopes, and struggles and how to overcome day-to-day and large-scale challenges.

Dramaturgy is most useful during a phase in the design process when concepts are almost finished since detailed account of emotions is required."	"Data from Focus Groups and Photo Diaries are used to compile timelines and personas of the users, which are then incorporated into a script for the dramaturgical research.

A general step-by-step procedure used by the Univeristy of Helsinki comprises of:
1. Character - Choose a character/user whose persona will be read by the designers.
2. Improvisation - Create small groups of designers, assigned to do theatrical improvisations in the form of a poster and/or trailer, as well as of the user's dreams and nightmares.
3. Monologues - On an individual basis, have the designers write monologues for the characters on the public (e.g. pitch at a meeting), private (e.g. conversation with a family member, and intimate (e.g. diary entry) levels.
4. User's Ideal - Have the designers discuss the mythological and ritualistic levels of the character's life while thinking about what an ideal world would like like for the character (i.e. user).
5. Mind Mapping - Have the designers individually create socio-political and/or relationship mind maps of the characters.
6. Scriptwriting - Have the entire group of designers create scenes depicting ""crucial moments"" in the character's life, making sure to include motives, hopes, challenges, and contextual elements.
7. Dramatization - Represent these scenarios on stage by trying to solve the problem(s) and overcome the challenge(s) intuitively."	"This method was originally created to make data traditionally inferred from Personas more dynamic.

Empathy Probes	Empathy Probes should be used to record and learn about potential user's private lives	 their surrounding world	 and experiences. This method is especially used to understand the user's emotional side including their feelings	 persona	 and manner of relating.	"1. Researchers must first design what methods will be used during the empathy probe. Think about what techniques will draw out the most relevant information for the target audience.
2. Assemble the probes: In the Heart Rate Monitor case the researchers assembled packages including a diary, illustrated postcards and a camera. They then sent the packages to the subjects with a letter with personal greetings and instructions.
3. Review the packages once returned.
4. Interview subjects and have them create a collage of their relation to their experience."	"Related Methods: Emphatic design, Interviews

Benefits of Method: 
-Much the Empathy Probe can be conducted by the subject without the researcher needing to be present. This not only reduces the time for the researcher but it allows the subject to be autonomous in their recording of their life and subsequently reveal more true to life practices.
-The Empathy Probes included a number of different methods within the umbrella method. The benefits of each are listed below:
1. Camera/Self-Photography: Allows subject to determine what to photograph rather than the researcher. Allows a greater time span for photographs when the subject takes the pictures as opposed to only the span of time that a researcher may be present.
2. Illustrated Cards: These cards (which looked like postcards with a relevant picture on the back and a survey type question on the other side) allowed a more personal manner of response to the question.
3. Diary: One woman in the Heart Rate monitor test said it was ""easier to express things in writting than out loud.
4. Interview: Interviews are done post probe so that the researcher has a more personal understanding of the interviewee and can get to more insightful points sooner.
5. Collage: Performed during interview about their experiences to reveal ""dreams and emotions"" of the subject.

Ethnofuturism	"Ethnofuturism combines forecasting methodologies with ethnographic observation to understand long term consumer trends. The purpose of Ethnofuturism is to allow designers to recognize users' needs.

Ethnofuturism is most ideal to use when testing the usability of the product and when nearing the prototyping phase."	"Ethnofuturism closely analyzes the relationships between the ethnographic research and the trend analysis to create ""Mega-trends,"" which can provide the design team with information appliances.

Overall, ethnofuturism can either be applied or used toward a final prototyping method called the 'IE System.' This system is created by first drawing pictures of the various prototyping processes onto post-it notes and then transferring the post-it notes directly to powerpoint slides and/or flash animations. Through Powerpoint and/or Flash, these ""steps"" in the prototyping can be linked so as to create a final software that will allow users to prototype potential products without using them directly.
"	"Knowledge of the ethnography can be applied to the futures perspective to create data that outlines and addresses future needs of consumers. Furthermore, the IE system allows for an efficient way to prototype in the form of interactive software.

Benefits of Method: 
-The IE System of Ethnofuturism allows more efficient prototyping of the product in development because the designers' lack of engineering knowledge is complemented by the usability of the flash/powerpoint interactive software.

Deficits of Method: 
-In making the design process more efficient, the IE system fails to prototype the product under development in the most intimate way since the designers generally lack the engineering skills and knowledge required to do so.

Experience Prototyping	"Experience prototyping is any representation, in any medium, that is designed to enhance the understanding, exploration or communication of what it might be like to engage with the product, space, or system a company is designing.

The authors emphasize that experience prototyping is not about the creation of a formalized toolkit or a set of techniques, but is rather about developing an attitude and language to solve design problems.

This method is essential to the middle stages of the designing process (i.e. before the final artifacts exist)."	"Having said that, there are three general situations in which Experience Prototyping is especially useful:
1. Understanding existing user experiences and context - This can be done by replicating a circumstance that a consumer could face, which is similar to an Autoethnography since the designer notes his or her personal experience.
2. Exploring and Evaluating Design Ideas - The main purpose of this is to facilitate the exploration of possible solutions and directing the design team towards a more informed development of the user expereince and the tangible components that create it. In this process, designers often use crude props to simulate experiences, reenact social situations, or simply observe people using prototypes in natural settings.
3. Communicating Ideas - The role of experience prototyping in this last category is to let a client, a design colleague, or a user understand the subjective value of a design idea by directly experiencing it in an effort to persuade the target audience of the design's value."	"Benefits of Method: 
- Experience Prototyping simulates important aspects of the relationships between people, places and objects as they unfold over time.
- Provides inspiration, confirmation, and rejection of ideas based on the quality of experience the prototyping elicits, in the process producing answers and feedback to designers’ questions about hypothetical situations.
- Enables others to engage directly in a proposed new experience, thereby providing a shared point of view.

Deficits of Method: 
There is no set guideline for appropriate representation among differing audiences. For users it may be difficult to provide an early, low-fidelity improvisation prototype of sufficiently robust nature that they can have an experience in a naturalistic context without supervision. At higher levels of fidelity, clients may become attached to early ideas when they experience a single convincing manifestation of many different possibilities and perceive it as the final solution.

Expert Evaluation	"
This method is used to identify usability problems based on established human factors principles. The method will provide recommendations for design improvements. However, as the method relies on experts, the output will naturally emphasise interface functionality and design rather than the properties of the interaction between an actual user and the product.

A heuristic or expert evaluation can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, although it is preferable to have already performed some form of context analysis to help the experts focus on the circumstances of actual or intended product usage."""	" Usually two to three analysts evaluate the system with reference to established guidelines or principles, noting down their observations and often ranking them in order of severity. The analysts are usually experts in human factors or HCI, but others, less experienced have also been shown to report valid problems.  
"	"Benefits of the method: The method provides quick and relatively cheap feedback to designers. The results generate good ideas for improving the user interface. The development team will also receive a good estimate of how much the user interface can be improved.

Users who are either extremely familiar or completely unfamiliar with a product are asked to evaluate their experience of using it. "	"Benefits of Method: 
-The unfamiliar user will most likely have an unbiased account of the product since his/her experience in using the product will be very little

Focus Groups	"A focus group is a forum of selected people controlled by an impartial moderator to give feedback to design ideas. They are normally one-off sessions although several may be run simultaneously in different locations. 
A facilitator leads a guided discussion of 6-12 people on a specific topic. A typical focus group normally lasts one or two hours and is normally recorded and a report is produced of the process and results. This is then distributed to all the participants. The focus group may be watched by the client or other interested parties. 

Focus groups provide useful information on how people respond to particular questions or issues, but the short amount of time limits the depth of discussion that can be had.

There are 2 possible times to conduct focus groups:
1. In the beginning during strategic research – when researching what the target market wants, focus groups are usually done after quantitative studies such as surveys, in order to explore statistics in greater depth.
2. At the end after the creative executions are done, finding out how the target market perceives the finished product so that adjustments can be made before the product is released to the public.

This method is often used as a complementary tool to interviews and observation."	"There are several Key Characteristics of a Successful Focus Group: 
1. Carefully select and prepare participants
2. Prepare well for the meeting
3. Create a democratic, supportive and informal atmosphere
3. Skillfully moderate the discussion
4. Pay attention to the individual needs of different consumers
5. 6-8 participants is an optimal number; however, sometimes larger numbers of participants representing differing viewpoints can raise important issues
6. May be desirable to include critical users representing the extremes of the user group to ensure inclusive design
"	"The 10 S's: 
1. Synergy – the group process generates a wider range of information than would accrue from a comparable number of depth interviews.
2. Snowballing – respondent interaction creating a chain of thought and ideas.
3. Serendipity – a great idea can drop out of the blue.
4. Stimulation – respondent’s views are brought out by the group process.
5. Security – respondents are more likely to be candid as there will probably be other similar people there, and there is less individual pressure than in a depth interview.
6. Spontaneity – because no one individual is required to respond to a question, this encourages a spontaneous response when people have a definite point of view.
7. Specialization – a trained moderator can interview more respondents in a given 7. session.
8. Structure – it is easier for the moderator to reintroduce a topic not adequately covered before than in a depth interview.
9. Speed – quicker than individual interviews.
10. Scrutiny – can be observed by members of the research team.

The term was first coined by psychologist and marketing expert Ernest Dichter. Focus groups have expanded in development greatly after 1987. Since then, they have been found useful in Sociology, Psychology, Social Science, Health etc. The scope of Focus group applications is far reaching, and development in all fields is continuing to grow.

Benefits of Method:
1. A focus group produces data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction that can be found in a group setting. Participants can inspire each other and cause them to remember or share things that would not have come out through a one-on-one interview.
2. Extrinsic issues of process (e.g. quicker, cheaper, observable by clients, easier to analyze)

Deficits of Method: 
1. Qualitative data is harder to analyze
2. Costly to hold focus groups
3. The success often hinges on having a good moderator
4. Unable to match the depth and detail generated by individual interviews and to uncover subtleties in attitudes. Deeper attitudinal data was felt to be closed off in the focus groups, yet was accessible in the individual depth interviews.

Participants generate a random list of things-animals	 objects	 or people and write them in index cards. For each item	 write the qualities or attributes. Then shuffle the cards and distribute them randomly. Then use the cards to develop analogies to the problem or issue at hand	 asking: How is this problem similar to [random object]? How would I solve this problem with [random oject]? A truly random list of objects will push the boundaries of the group's mindset and create new perspectives. 	"benefit of the method:

Forced ranking	When prioritizing	 a group may need to agree on a single	 ranked list of items. Forced ranking obligates the group to make difficult decisions	 and each item is ranked relative to the others. This is an important step in making decisions on items like investments-wherever a clear	 prioritized list is needed. 	"To set up the game, participants need to have two things: an unranked list of items and the criteria for ranking them. Because forced ranking makes the group judge items closely, the criteria should be clear as possible. In a small group setting, the ideal length of a list is about 10 items. 

To play, create  a matrix of items and the criteria. Each participant ranks the items by assigning it a number, with the most important being #1, second most important item as #2, and so forth, to the least important item. Because of the ranking is ""forced"" no items can receive equal weight. Once the items have been ranked, tally them and discuss the prioritized list and next steps. "	"Difficulty of the method:

Participants use these lists to populate a matrix	 creating a grid of new possible combinaions. In playing this game	 participants look across the cells for unusual or surprizing combinations. these become the seeds of new ideas.

1. the role of the product
2. it slook and feel
3. its technical implementation

Role refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which it is useful to them. 

Look and feel is concerned with questions about the concrete sensory experience of using an artifact—what the user looks at, feels and hears while using it. 

Implementation refers to algorithms and engineering techniques used to realize functionality of a product — “the ‘nuts and bolts’ of how it actually works.”"		http://roschuni.com/wiki/index.php/Integration_Prototypes	Building prototypes and mockups		"Hartmann.

1. What is the purpose of the product? 2. How does the product function to meet its purpose? 
3. How does it look and feel?"	Like industrial design	 the discipline would start from the needs and desires of the people who use a product or service	 and strive to create designs that would give aesthetic pleasure as well as lasting satisfaction and enjoyment.	http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/interaction_design.html	"Generating Ideas and Concepts

Interaction Table	The interaction table is a diagram supporting strategic discussion. 	"In the interaction table, the actors (both the users and the service staff) are located vertically and divided by the different lines of interaction.

The external line of interaction separates the real users  from the other users involved in the service experience.
The central line of interaction separates the users from the figures that are part of the service organization and finally the internal line of interaction separates the front line staff from the back-office. 

Each actor is the protagonist of a storyboard that illustrates the process with the support of detailed specifications. 

The process can be read horizontally, actors by actors, in order to get a description of the role and the activities of each figure, but the process can also be read vertically in order to find the correspondences between the activities of the different subjects."		http://www.servicedesigntools.org/tools/37	"Evalauting and Choosing

Intervention/Provocation	"Intervention is a method in which  the designer places 2D graphic visualisations or 3D objects within an environment to stimulate discussion and elicit a response from the user. 

These designed elements take the form of interventions or provocations within the research process, engaging a person’s imagination and encouraging a fuller response in ways that more formal interview and questionnaire techniques cannot achieve.

Thie purpose of this method is to elicit greater engagement by the user and better understanding of their motivation

This method should be used in the earlier stages of the design process – exploration and focus."	" The designer places 2D graphic visualisations or 3D objects within an environment to stimulate discussion and elicit a response from the user.

Interviews	" One-on-one interviews provide information about individual actions and motivations that cannot be obtained in group discussions.

The purpose of interviews is to gain deeper insight into people’s needs and perspectives

This method should be used in early to mid stages of the design process.

"	"Process:
An interview is a conversation between a researcher and a respondent selected according to agreed criteria.

It typically lasts an hour or two and may take place in any agreed setting.

Interviews are particularly suitable for discussing sensitive issues, product categories where over-claiming or under-claiming is known to be a problem, and cases where individuality is of prime importance."	"Benefits of the method: 
Perfect for discussing:
-Circumstances of unique applicability, especially those involving sensitive or personal topics
-Product categories where over-claiming or under-claiming is known to be a problem
-Cases where individuality is of prime importance-
Preferred to focus groups where people would be swayed by other participants' beliefs and conversation

Deficits of the method: 
-Success depends on the interviewer's level of interpersonal skills
-Individual depth interviews are more difficult to interpret, due to the sequential nature of data gathering masking an overview of consensus

Active Listening	"Active listening is a specific communication skill, based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, which involves giving free and undivided attention to the speaker. Knights defines free attention as: ‘... placing all of one’s attention and awareness at the disposal of another person, listening with interest and appreciating without interrupting.’ The purpose of Active Listening is to achieve a greater understanding of what the listener is trying to convey. 

In design, Active Listening is especially useful when conducting interviews. "	"Active Listening Skills:

Attentive body language
- Posture and gestures showing involvement and engagement
-Appropriate body movement
-Appropriate facial expressions
-Appropriate eye contact
- Nondistracting environment

Following Skills (Giving the speaker space to tell their story their own way)
- Interested 'door openers'
- Minimal verbal encouragers
- Infrequent, timely and considered questions
- Attentive silences
Reflecting Skills (restating the feeling and/or content with understanding and acceptance)
- Paraphrase (check periodically that you've understood)
- Reflect back feelings and content
- Summarize the major issues"	"Related Methods: Interviews, Expert interviews, Extreme User Interviews, Dyad Interviews, Pre-Interviews, Structures Interviews, Triad Interviews, Photo-elicitation interviews

As Carl Rogers said in 1980: ‘Attentive listening means giving one’s total and undivided attention to the other person and tells the other that we are interested and concerned. Listening is difficult work that we will not undertake unless we have deep respect and care for the other... we listen not only with our ears, but with our eyes, mind, heart and imagination, as well. We listen to what is going on within ourselves, as well as to what is taking place in the person we are hearing. We listen to the words of the other, but we also listen to the messages buried in the words. We listen to the voice, the appearance, and the body language of the other... We simply try to absorb ever ything the speaker is saying verbally and nonverbally without adding, subtracting, or amending’."	"Robertson K (2005). Active listening: more than just paying attention.

Atomize	"This exercise starts with a single item and ends with a layer-by-layer analysis of its components. It is useful for unpacking large but poorly understood structures. 1. Open the exercise by putting the name of the system on a sticky note at the top of a large whiteboard. Introduce the exercise as a way to understand what the system is made of in tangible terms, by breaking it down into its atoms. 2. To start the brainstorming, ask the group to ""split"" the main system into its components. In this step you are generating a list of things to capture on sticky notes directly below the main topic. Generally, a short list of three to five large components is the norm. 3. For each item, repeat the splitting process by asking ""What combines to create this?""

Ensure that all your targeted population has been given a questionnaire to fill out. If you are doing a mail-shot, expect approximately 20% response rate. This may be higher if you are doing it via the web. You can increase your response rate to nearly 100% by doing reminder personal calls. If you are using the questionnaire as part of a lab test, ensure that the questionnaires as filled out can be associated with all the other data (time scores, tapes, sample outputs etc.) from the respondents - so you don’t have questionnaires which you cannot match up with the rest of the data.

It is usual not to prompt the respondent how to reply. If a respondent complains that a question is inapplicable or wrong, tell them words to the effect that it is up to them to make their own judgement about each question, and that there are no right or wrong answers.

Brainstorming	Brain storming is one of the oldest known methods for generating group creativity. A group of people come together and focus on a problem or proposal.	 There are two phases of the activity. The first phase generates ideas	 the second phase evaluates them. An experienced facilitator is useful.	"Although some studies have shown that individuals working alone can generate more and better ideas than when working as a group, the brainstorming activity enables everyone in the group to gain a better understanding of the problem space, and has the added benefit of creating a feeling of common ownership of results.

Brainwriting	"simple way to generate ideas, share them, and build on them within a group. Process: 1. Write the topicaround which you need to generate ideas and draw a picture of it. 2. Distribute index cards to each player and ask them to silently generate ideas related to the topic and write them on the cards. 3 As they complete each idea, ask the players to pass that idea to the person on their right.4. Tell the players to read the cared they received and think of it as an ""idea stimulation"" card. Ask them to add an idea inspired by what they just read or to enhance the idea and then pass again to their right. 5. continue this process of ""brainwriting"" and passing cards to the right until there are various ideas on each card. 6. once finished, collect the cards and ask for help taping them to the wall around the topic and its picture. 7.

Canonical Abstract Prototyping	"Canonical Abstract Prototyping is an extension to user-centered design that provides a formal vocabulary for expressing visual and interaction design without concern for details of apperance and behavior. The ultimate result of the abstract prototyping process is a complete but abstract provisional design for the entire user interface. Such an abstract prototype can be validated against the task model by walking through task cases or scenarios to verify that tasks can be performed with reasonable efficiency given the tools and materials available.

Canonical Abstract Prototyping is appropriate when attempting to take a task model and create a complete yet abstract conceptual design for the entire user interface. This makes generating a realistic model more straightforward."	"To generate the canonical abstract model from a task model:
1. For each cluster of closely related task cases, an interaction context is provisionally defined. For each task case in a cluster, the defining dialog or narrative is examined.
2. For each step in the narrative, the interface contents necessary for performance of the step are identified and appropriate abstract tools and materials are added to the contents of the interaction context. In practice, this is often accomplished using sticky notes to represent abstract components
3. Where specialized Canonical Abstract Components are clearly needed or preferred, these are used; otherwise, generic tools, materials, or combinations are used. Canonical Abstract Components model the various interactive functions–such as interrupting an action or displaying a collection of information–needed within the realized user interface.
4. Once all the necessary tools and materials have been incorporated into the interaction context, the layout and organization of the interaction context are explored. Area is allocated based on such things as importance, complexity, and user focus.
5. Abstract Components are positioned according to such issues as workflow and conceptual or semantic interrelationships and may be by combined into composite components when meaningful and potentially useful."	"Canonical Abstract Prototypes emerged from a workshop of practitioners convened in 2000 by Constantine & Lockwood, Ltd.

Card Sort	Card sort is a practice used frequently by information architcts and designers to gather and structure inputs for a variety of purposes. Similar to Post-Up and affinity mapping	 however it differs because cards needs to be generally prepared in advance and cards are semi-permanents artifact and can be used as a control over several exercises with different participants to find patterns among them. 		Reveals thought process of participants. 		pg 61-62																							
CARD Sorting	"Description: ""Card Sorting essentially involves the design team selecting a group of people to """"organize cards spatially, in ways that make sense to them."""" ""    
""Although there are many different sorting techniques (from hierarchical to Q sorts often used in psychology), the repeated single-criterion ""    
sort is the best for the design process since statistical analysis of the respondents sorting can reveal important trends and patterns of the general consumer market.    
"	"In Single-Criterion sorting, the respondents are given a criterion by the designers (e.g. with cards representing the various applications on a phone, the category could be frequency of use). The respondents then sort the cards into categories (e.g. once a day, twice a day, etc. for the phone applications example). Analysis after various categorizations over different criteria eventually allows designers to understand which features are most important and/or useful to consumers.

Tips: Design team needs to sort cards in ways that make sense to them. "	"Benefits of the method: The users can utilize all their senses when investigating the cards allowing them to possibly create new categories of sorting that may not have appeared before.

Deficits of the method: 
Often times, the objects can have strange and/or unwanted relationships that skew the sorting away from the intended categories and perspectives. Furthermore, the sorting can only address ""static, flat, [and] explicit knowledge,"" rather than providing more tacit knowledge about structured relationships.

CARD Technique	"The CARD (Collaborative Analysis of Requirement and Design) technique essentially creates cards that explain the results of the discussions, all of which can be used for more formal analytical techniques. This method is used to help the Design Team's members better understand each other's backgrounds and work history, as well as brainstorm innovations to improve the current design process. 

CARD sorting is best used in the very beginning of the design process when design teams are first created."	"A typical CARD session progresses as follows:
1. Introducing People - Team members introduce their names, workplace group interests, etc.
2. Introducing Materials - Each person fills out his/her card with an activity or component of an activity that could occur in the workplace.
3. Work of the Session - The team engages in three sessions of deep involvement:
- Participatory Analysis - Each user describes his or her work and the other members ask questions
- Participatory Design - The entire team discusses a user's work and/or possible innovations in work practice and technologies.
- Participatory Assessment - The entire team collectively critiques a specific work practice."	"The first documented usage of CARD Technique was that of the studies in the work of U S West telephone companies during 1993-1996 Cards for the CARD sessions were based off of the training materials required of the components of the work, and included activities such as ""customers' requests and clarifications, operators' work with keyboard and screen,"" etc.

Classic Ethnography	Purpose: This method can be used to gain a descriptive understanding of potential customers in settings in which the new product will be employed.

Natural Settings: Research and observations must be conducted in field settings rather than in laboratories
Holism: Behaviors must be understood in everyday contexts, how they fit into larger society

Members' Point of View: Must situate oneself in point of view of the observed

Classic Ethnography	This method can be used to gain a descriptive understanding of potential customers in settings in which the new product will be employed. This method can also be used to observe and analyze consumers interactions with the products. Through Classic Ethnography	 the designer will gain self-refexictiy through participant observation and an encompassing understanding of subjects' interactions with objects within environment as a whole.

Note: differences between ethnography and traditional methods is that traditional methods, with the exception of field trips, take the user out of the natural setting. The focus is largely on the acceptability of a product rather than the relationship between the user and the product. Ethnography provides a higher chance for the designer to incorporate users' desires.

Blomberg emphasizes guiding principles when applying ethnography to design research so as to maintain the method's authenticity:
Natural Settings: Research and observations must be conducted in field settings rather than in laboratories
Holism: Behaviors must be understood in everyday contexts, how they fit into larger society
Descriptive: Descriptive understanding derives from how people actually behave versus how they ought to; non-judgmental
Members' Point of View: Must situate oneself in point of view of the observed

First applied to product design in the 1980s when traditional view that technologies supported individual tasks shifted to view that technologies should assist collaboration and cooperation among people. (Blomberg) New field developed: Computer Support for Cooperative Work (also, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work) (CSCW) to design computer software and tooks for group work. Anthropologists, using ethnographic processes, examined everyday practices of computer users. Found large discrepancy between software programmer's intuition for how intended users would use programs and how consumers actually used them.

2. Inventory all contrasts previously discovered - Possibly start  with notes complied from asking contrast questions and/or making selective observations. (e.g. Aremnian Catholics speak Armenian as a first language; Shunni speak Arabic as a first language.)
3. Prepare a paradigm worksheet - consists of an empty paradigm in which you enter the cultural categories of the domain down the lefthand column, while making notes about the relationships between the paradigm and the other domains.
4. Identify dimensions of contrast that have binary values - A dimension of contrast is an idea or concept that has at least two parts, although in this case it specifically has two parts since the values must be binary. (e.g. If you were analyzing the domain ""kinds of trees,"" you would come up with one dimension of contrast that might be stated ""characterized by the presence of leaves."" This is a dimension of contrast related to trees and has two values or parts: ""yes"" or ""no."")
5. Combine closely related dimensions of contrast into ones that have multipe values - Instead of ""yes"" or ""no"" dimensions of contrast, add more complex ones such as ""First language,"" providing more qualitative information.
6. Prepare contrast questions for missing attributes
7. Conduct selective observations to discover missing information
8. Prepare a completed paradigm - This final paradigm can be used as a chart in ethnographic research."	"Related Methods: Classic Ethnography, Rapid Ethnography, Quick and Dirty Ethnography, Participant Observation, Taxonomies

Componential Analysis has been most frequently used to breakdown the meanings of somewhat related words with particular emphasis placed on kinship analysis words (eg: brother, mother, aunt) and their translation between languages. For example, one could compare the terms sister and brother and find that these terms are parallel in the sense that both are children of the same parent but will find that the words differ in gender identified.

James P. Spradley was on the forefront of using this term for ethnographic purposes when he published his book ""Participant Observation"" in 1980.

Concept mapping	"Description: Concept mapping is a process that involves the identification of concepts in study materials and their organization from the most to the least general, more specific concepts (Novak, 1981, p. 3). Concept maps (CM) have been used as a tool for assessing meaningful learning (e.g. Novak, 1979), as well as in curriculum planning, instruction and evaluation (e.g Stewart et al., 1979).

Context:   Concept mapping can be utilized in multiple ways including: lesson planning, study guides, and tutorial outlines.

Purpose: The usage of concept mapping prevents mistakenly omitting important material as well as highlight the necessity of understanding how concepts relate to each other in a logical manner."	"1    Identify a particular activity or topic with a desire to understand more completely. It is most effective to clearly define the range of the topic so as keep the map contained and focused. Writing a Focus Question is a good way to define the domain of the map.    
2    Designate the key concepts that are within this domain. A possible approach is to list the concepts and rank the concepts from most general to most specific.    
3    Begin the concept map by placing all concepts in a space where they can easily be shifted. A good method to placing concepts in the map is to organize them by those with similar ranking and those that are easily relatable.    
4     Then create links between concepts in sub-domains. These links may contain specific words or phrases that clearly connect the concepts in order to clearly indicate their relationship.    
5    A concept map requires continuous editing as new comprehension is introduced"	"Benefits of the method: 
Research shows that concept mapping helps in gaining better and more comprehensive understanding of the learning material (Gurley, 1982). [3]

Contextual Design	"Description: Contextual Design refers to a customer-centric approach to design where customer data forms the foundation for what a system does and how it is structured. It means working from customer data to design implications to specific features, a process fueled by the customer's needs, not technology's mandates. CD makes explicit the implications of customer data in design. CD ""gives the whole organization a single focus for parallel efforts”.

Context: Contextual Design has primarily been used for the design of computer information and IT systems, including hardware (Curtis et al 1999) and software (Rockwell 1999)."	1. contextual design:  One-on-one interaction with people in the work place	 while they work.

2. Work Modeling: Work models are created during the interpretation sessions introduced above. These work models take one of five forms, and allow a concrete, visual representation of the work that each interviewed customer engages in.
3. Consolidation: In this stage the team finds the common structure of the customers' work, bringing the many details together to produce a cohesive pattern. A single picture of the population is made explicit. This part of the CD process uses two tools: affinity diagrams and work models. Affinity diagrams illustrate each detail from each interviewed customer's experience, while work models integrate these details into an overarching picture. This picture then guides the design team in their task.
4. Work Redesign: Work Redesign focuses on the ways that the customers' work experience can be improved-- before any new technology or system is put in place. It takes the vision developed from the Consolidation stage and uses it as a base for any brainstorms of new technologies. Storyboards of how the experience would be different are helpful in this stage.
5. User Environment Design: User Environment Design makes the new system--and the new way of working that this implies--explicit. In this step each part of the new system is tied to the customer's work model, including ""how it supports the user's work, exactly what function is available in that part, and how it connects with other parts of the system"" (Beyer & Holtzblatt 24). This step justifies the new system's many parts, without having to commit and without involving a user interface. With each part of the step made explicit, the team can ensure that the many parts relate to one another and meet the customers' needs. It ensures coherence in the design process, keeping the system focused on the customer data.

This part of the process uses paper prototypes to introduce the initial concept of the design to the customer. This prototyping session with the customer enables the design team to work with the customers and individualize the system to meet their needs.

Contextual Inquiry	"Contextual Design refers to a customer-centric approach to design where customer data forms the foundation for what a system does and how it is structured. It means working from customer data to design implications to specific features, a process fueled by the customer's needs, not technology's mandates.

Contextual Inquiry is the first step in conducting a thorough contextual design analysis."	"1. Contextual Inquiry: One-on-one interaction with people in the work place, while they work. Team interpretation sessions, where each member of the team puts their own perspective to bear on the data. This produces a shared understanding of the customer.
2. Work Modeling: Work models are created during the interpretation sessions introduced above. These work models take one of five forms, and allow a concrete, visual representation of the work that each interviewed customer engages in.
3. Consolidation: In this stage the team finds the common structure of the customers' work, bringing the many details together to produce a cohesive pattern. A single picture of the population is made explicit. This part of the CD process uses two tools: affinity diagrams and work models. Affinity diagrams illustrate each detail from each interviewed customer's experience, while work models integrate these details into an overarching picture. This picture then guides the design team in their task.
4. Work Redesign: Work Redesign focuses on the ways that the customers' work experience can be improved-- before any new technology or system is put in place. It takes the vision developed from the Consolidation stage and uses it as a base for any brainstorms of new technologies. Storyboards of how the experience would be different are helpful in this stage.
5. User Environment Design: User Environment Design makes the new system--and the new way of working that this implies--explicit. In this step each part of the new system is tied to the customer's work model, including ""how it supports the user's work, exactly what function is available in that part, and how it connects with other parts of the system"" (Beyer & Holtzblatt 24). This step justifies the new system's many parts, without having to commit and without involving a user interface. With each part of the step made explicit, the team can ensure that the many parts relate to one another and meet the customers' needs. It ensures coherence in the design process, keeping the system focused on the customer data.
6. Mock-Up & Test with Customers: Any system needs to be tested and tweaked before being finalized. This part of the process uses paper prototypes to introduce the initial concept of the design to the customer. This prototyping session with the customer enables the design team to work with the customers and individualize the system to meet their needs. Partnering with the client then spurs a detailed user interface and improved system.
7. Putting into Practice: Implement! The last step is to tailor your design system to the workplace itself."	"Contexual inquiry was developed by Karen Holtzblatt in 1995 to ""design a process that would lead to new kinds of systems rather than iterating existing systems"".

Critical Incident Technique Analysis	"End users are asked to identify specific incidents which they experienced personally and which had an important effect on the final outcome. The emphasis is on incidents rather than vague opinions. 


The context of the incident may also be elicited. Data from many users is collected and analysed."	The CIT is a method for getting a subjective report while minimising interference from stereotypical reactions or received opinions. The user is asked to focus on one or more critical incidents which they experienced personally in the field of activity being analysed. A critical incident is defined as one which had an important effect on the final outcome. Critical incidents can only be recognised retrospectively.	"Benefits of the method: The CIT is an open-ended retrospective method of finding out what users feel are the critical features of the software being evaluated. It is more flexible than a questionnaire or survey and is recommended in situations where the only alternative is to develop a questionnaire or survey from the start. It focuses on user behaviour, so it can be used in situations where video recording is not practicable so long as the inherent bias of retrospective judgement is understood.

"	"Many points have been taken to make the subject feel more comfortable, at ease, and interested in completing their research assignments than many other methods. Cultural probes allow the subject to be very self directed in their responses which will allow this research to bring out even more about their habits than a lead-questioning method. For example, the personal survey questions are on postcards. The cards are also pre-postmarked to an individual researcher by name, rather than the research firm inc. This helps the subject respond to the given questions in a natural, friendly, and hopefully more insightful manner.

Deficits of Method:
-The return is dependent on the individual completing the work and mailing it in. In some communities there were nearly full responses from the members of the elder community however in others there were less than half responses.
-Lack of quantitate data that can be extracted 
-More time intensive and costly due to the preparation of the materials and the personal visits to the community

This section consisted of an e-mail excerpt, followed by two simple questions. One question simply asked who the recipient of the e-mail was (one could simply look up at the e-mail excerpt to find the answer), and the other question asked about the specifics of the content in the e-mail. This section showed how willing the user was to closely read the e-mail - this turns out to be an efficient predictor of how genuinely the user answered the survey in general. Results showed that students and adults older than 40 tended to answer these last couple of questions correctly, and were thus most likely genuinely interested in answering the survey's questions (i.e. rather than answering the questions merely for the sake of the ""micro payments"""

Deliberative Mapping	"Deliberative Mapping involves both specialists and members of the public. It combines varied approaches to assess how participants rate different policy options against a set of defined criteria. 
The citizen and expert participants are divided into panels (often according to gender and socio-economic background to ensure that people are comfortable voicing their views). The citizens' panels and the experts consider the issue both separately from one another and at a joint workshop. 
This allows both groups to learn from each other without the experts dominating. The emphasis of the process is not on integrating expert and public voices, but understanding the different perspectives each offer to a policy process. 
The groups themselves determine which criteria they will use to score the options against, thereby limiting any structural bias. Deliberative Mapping incorporates both quantitative and qualitative methods and participants work both individually and as a group."

Design-in-Context	Use Design-in-Context in the beginning of the design phase. This method can be used in contexts of defined boundaries - such as a in factory. Is also very useful to test prototypes and observe how the user interacts and relates to the new product.	"Werner Sperschneider & Kirsten Bagger's article on ""Ethnographic fieldwork under industrial constraints"" outlines a method called Design-in-Context that uses Participant Observation to acquire data on design:
1. Situated Interview: ""Tell me what you do""; qualitative interview techniques 
2. Simulated Use: ""Show me how you do it""; obsesrve simulated use
3. Acting Out: ""Show me your normal procedure""; observe work routines
4. Shadowing: ""Let me walk with you""; follow users in daily routine
5. Apprenticeship: ""Teach me how""; designer steps into user's role and draw insider perspective

Sperschneider and Bagger have adapted the participant observation method used in ethnography for industrial environments. However, the general outline of this process can be duplicated and adapted for other design projects. Unlike classic ethnographic fieldwork, however, this method has time constraints and may be similar to rapid ethnography in that respect."

Participants were asked to keep diary entries for two weeks whenever they were mobile. Diary entries were later categorized based on participant logs and feedback during interviews. Found in the study that many information needs were postponed or un-addressed due to costs and contextual factors. At times	 even participants with mobile internet access had to postpone their needs due to situational and contextual factors.	http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/321-1089/all/1/resus-station.aspx																						
Diary Studies	"The purpose of Diary Studies is to capture data that is difficult to retrieve; e.g. participants' actions and behaviors, their thoughts, feelings and reflections.

Diary studies can be used during the beginning of the design phase to capture participant data on actions and behaviors."	"1. Have a focus of the study
2. Select participants
3. Instruct participants on how to use diary:
- Feedback studies: participants answer pre-defined questions about the events
- Elicitation studies: participants record media and interview discussions are structured according to the captured media
4. Look for patterns and insight"	"Benefits of Method:
-Less memory lapses and retrospective messaging since period between event occurrence and recording is short
- Enables researcher to understand the interplay between person and environment as perceived by the diary keeper
- Helps further studies in the laboratory

Deficits of Method:
- Process is tedious and time consuming.
- Risk of delay between event occurrence and recording
- Success of diaries rely heavily on participant cooperation

2. Improvisation - Create small groups of designers, assigned to do theatrical improvisations in the form of a poster and/or trailer, as well as of the user's dreams and nightmares.
3. Monologues - On an individual basis, have the designers write monologues for the characters on the public (e.g. pitch at a meeting), private (e.g. conversation with a family member, and intimate (e.g. diary entry) levels.
4. User's Ideal - Have the designers discuss the mythological and ritualistic levels of the character's life while thinking about what an ideal world would like like for the character (i.e. user).
5. Mind Mapping - Have the designers individually create socio-political and/or relationship mind maps of the characters.
6. Scriptwriting - Have the entire group of designers create scenes depicting ""crucial moments"" in the character's life, making sure to include motives, hopes, challenges, and contextual elements.

Benefits of Method: 
-Much the Empathy Probe can be conducted by the subject without the researcher needing to be present. This not only reduces the time for the researcher but it allows the subject to be autonomous in their recording of their life and subsequently reveal more true to life practices.
-The Empathy Probes included a number of different methods within the umbrella method. The benefits of each are listed below:
1. Camera/Self-Photography: Allows subject to determine what to photograph rather than the researcher. Allows a greater time span for photographs when the subject takes the pictures as opposed to only the span of time that a researcher may be present.
2. Illustrated Cards: These cards (which looked like postcards with a relevant picture on the back and a survey type question on the other side) allowed a more personal manner of response to the question.
3. Diary: One woman in the Heart Rate monitor test said it was ""easier to express things in writting than out loud.
4. Interview: Interviews are done post probe so that the researcher has a more personal understanding of the interviewee and can get to more insightful points sooner.
5. Collage: Performed during interview about their experiences to reveal ""dreams and emotions"" of the subject.

Ethnofuturism	"Ethnofuturism combines forecasting methodologies with ethnographic observation to understand long term consumer trends. The purpose of Ethnofuturism is to allow designers to recognize users' needs.

"Ethnofuturism closely analyzes the relationships between the ethnographic research and the trend analysis to create ""Mega-trends,"" which can provide the design team with information appliances.

Overall, ethnofuturism can either be applied or used toward a final prototyping method called the 'IE System.' This system is created by first drawing pictures of the various prototyping processes onto post-it notes and then transferring the post-it notes directly to powerpoint slides and/or flash animations. Through Powerpoint and/or Flash, these ""steps"" in the prototyping can be linked so as to create a final software that will allow users to prototype potential products without using them directly.
"	"Knowledge of the ethnography can be applied to the futures perspective to create data that outlines and addresses future needs of consumers. Furthermore, the IE system allows for an efficient way to prototype in the form of interactive software.

Benefits of Method: 
-The IE System of Ethnofuturism allows more efficient prototyping of the product in development because the designers' lack of engineering knowledge is complemented by the usability of the flash/powerpoint interactive software.

Deficits of Method: 
-In making the design process more efficient, the IE system fails to prototype the product under development in the most intimate way since the designers generally lack the engineering skills and knowledge required to do so.

The authors emphasize that experience prototyping is not about the creation of a formalized toolkit or a set of techniques, but is rather about developing an attitude and language to solve design problems.

This method is essential to the middle stages of the designing process (i.e. before the final artifacts exist)."	"Having said that, there are three general situations in which Experience Prototyping is especially useful:
1. Understanding existing user experiences and context - This can be done by replicating a circumstance that a consumer could face, which is similar to an Autoethnography since the designer notes his or her personal experience.
2. Exploring and Evaluating Design Ideas - The main purpose of this is to facilitate the exploration of possible solutions and directing the design team towards a more informed development of the user expereince and the tangible components that create it. In this process, designers often use crude props to simulate experiences, reenact social situations, or simply observe people using prototypes in natural settings.
3. Communicating Ideas - The role of experience prototyping in this last category is to let a client, a design colleague, or a user understand the subjective value of a design idea by directly experiencing it in an effort to persuade the target audience of the design's value."	"Benefits of Method: 
- Experience Prototyping simulates important aspects of the relationships between people, places and objects as they unfold over time.
- Provides inspiration, confirmation, and rejection of ideas based on the quality of experience the prototyping elicits, in the process producing answers and feedback to designers’ questions about hypothetical situations.
- Enables others to engage directly in a proposed new experience, thereby providing a shared point of view.

Deficits of Method: 
There is no set guideline for appropriate representation among differing audiences. For users it may be difficult to provide an early, low-fidelity improvisation prototype of sufficiently robust nature that they can have an experience in a naturalistic context without supervision. At higher levels of fidelity, clients may become attached to early ideas when they experience a single convincing manifestation of many different possibilities and perceive it as the final solution.

Expert Evaluation	"Heuristic evaluation is a form of usability inspection where usability specialists judge whether each element of a user interface follows a list of established usability heuristics.     
""Expert evaluation is similar, but does not use specific heuristics.""    
""Usually two to three analysts evaluate the system with reference to established guidelines or principles, noting down their observations and often ranking them in order of severity.

""A heuristic or expert evaluation can be conducted at various stages of the development lifecycle, although it is preferable to have already performed some form of context analysis to help the experts focus on the circumstances of actual or intended product usage."" "	This method is to identify usability problems based on established human factors principles. The method will provide recommendations for design improvements. However	 as the method relies on experts	 the output will naturally emphasise interface functionality and design rather than the properties of the interaction between an actual user and the product.	"Benefits of the method: The method provides quick and relatively cheap feedback to designers. The results generate good ideas for improving the user interface. The development team will also receive a good estimate of how much the user interface can be improved.

Focus Group	A focus group is a staged face-to-face discussion typically involving 6-12 people and chaired by an impartial moderator. Its aim is to solicit focused feedback on specific issues or design ideas	 giving designers firsthand experience of user reaction. Selection of focus group participants is critical as group dynamics play a key role. Some participants may be empowered	 other intimidated. Focus groups should therefore work in conjunction with other methods such as interviews	 giving everyone the opportunity to contribute.	understand	 measure	Focus groups can take a great deal of time and energy to organise	 but for the inclusive design process it can offer fresh insights for design researchers as well as generate wider understanding between participants	 a win-win situation…’ Design anthropologist Jo-Anne Bichard		http://designingwithpeople.rca.ac.uk/methods/focus-group	DADDY COOL (website)	http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/en/About-Design/Design-Methods/Character-profile...																
Focus Groups	"Focus groups are guided discussions of a small group of citizens. They are normally one-off sessions although several may be run simultaneously in different locations. 
A facilitator leads a guided discussion of 6-12 people on a specific topic. A typical focus group normally lasts one or two hours and is normally recorded and a report is produced of the process and results. This is then distributed to all the participants. The focus group may be watched by the client or other interested parties. 
Focus groups provide useful information on how people respond to particular questions or issues, but the short amount of time limits the depth of discussion that can be had."	understand		Focus groups allow for an in depth discussion on a specific topic with a few people over a couple of hours.  It allows the client to have a greater understanding of what may lie behind an opinion or how people approach an issue. 	User panels	 Members of the focus group can be selected to be representative of the population at large or of a specific group of the population. It can be a good way of engaging marginalised groups. 	http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Focus+Groups		http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project.cfm?id=209																				
Focus Groups	"A focus group is a forum of selected people controlled by an impartial moderator to give feedback to design ideas. 

There are 2 possible times to conduct focus groups:
1. In the beginning during strategic research – when researching what the target market wants, focus groups are usually done after quantitative studies such as surveys, in order to explore statistics in greater depth.
2. At the end after the creative executions are done, finding out how the target market perceives the finished product so that adjustments can be made before the product is released to the public.

This method is often used as a complementary tool to interviews and observation."	"There are several Key Characteristics of a Successful Focus Group: 1. Carefully select and prepare participants
2. Prepare well for the meeting
3. Create a democratic, supportive and informal atmosphere
3. Skillfully moderate the discussion
4. Pay attention to the individual needs of different consumers
5. 6-8 participants is an optimal number; however, sometimes larger numbers of participants representing differing viewpoints can raise important issues
6. May be desirable to include critical users representing the extremes of the user group to ensure inclusive design
"	"The 10 S's: 
1. Synergy – the group process generates a wider range of information than would accrue from a comparable number of depth interviews.
2. Snowballing – respondent interaction creating a chain of thought and ideas.
3. Serendipity – a great idea can drop out of the blue.
4. Stimulation – respondent’s views are brought out by the group process.
5. Security – respondents are more likely to be candid as there will probably be other similar people there, and there is less individual pressure than in a depth interview.
6. Spontaneity – because no one individual is required to respond to a question, this encourages a spontaneous response when people have a definite point of view.
7. Specialization – a trained moderator can interview more respondents in a given 7. session.
8. Structure – it is easier for the moderator to reintroduce a topic not adequately covered before than in a depth interview.
9. Speed – quicker than individual interviews.
10. Scrutiny – can be observed by members of the research team.

The term was first coined by psychologist and marketing expert Ernest Dichter. Focus groups have expanded in development greatly after 1987. Since then, they have been found useful in Sociology, Psychology, Social Science, Health etc. The scope of Focus group applications is far reaching, and development in all fields is continuing to grow.

Benefits of Method:
1. A focus group produces data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction that can be found in a group setting. Participants can inspire each other and cause them to remember or share things that would not have come out through a one-on-one interview.
2. Extrinsic issues of process (e.g. quicker, cheaper, observable by clients, easier to analyze)

Deficits of Method: 
1. Qualitative data is harder to analyze
2. Costly to hold focus groups
3. The success often hinges on having a good moderator
4. Unable to match the depth and detail generated by individual interviews and to uncover subtleties in attitudes. Deeper attitudinal data was felt to be closed off in the focus groups, yet was accessible in the individual depth interviews.

Improvisation	"Designers may play a large variety of these group games before or during any design period. Games can last anywhere from 5mins to 1 hour depending on structure and time desired to play.
Various Games include:
* Yes and...
* Group Drawing
* Im in a Tree
* Circle of words
* Circle of non-associated words
* What are you doing?
* More-Less"		Improvisation can be used in many different ways to facilitate the design process. It can increase creativity	 innovative thinking	 teamwork	 constructive thought	 spontaneity	 ability to work towards a common goal and presentation skills	 while it decreases fear of failure	 and self promoting action		http://roschuni.com/wiki/index.php/Improvisation																	
Improvisation	Way of thinking with your body. Example role play	 where you take the role of a character	 imagine a situation	 and act as you you think your character would act in that situation. 				pg 24																					
Informance	"Informance Design is used to render scenarios as plays and interactive environments, allowing designer “actors” to role-play as consumers, using simple prototypes as their “props.""
The process, though presented in a linear format, has considerable overlap.

The mise en scène of the information is called informance. It means representing an idea by acting in order to tell, explain and share it.
Either the actors are professionals or not, the way the story is represented should be relevant with reference with the contents so that the presentation becomes a real support for the communication of the idea and not an element of distraction.

Integration Prototype	"Integration Prototypes strive to address the three main ways in which prototypes can be valuable to designers. Houde and Hill define the three types of questions a prototype can address as: the role of a product in the larger use context; its look and feel; and its technical implementation. [1] [2]
Role refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which it is useful to them. Look and feel is concerned with questions about the concrete sensory experience of using an artifact—what the user looks at, feels and hears while using it. Implementation refers to algorithms and engineering techniques used to realize functionality of a product — “the ‘nuts and bolts’ of how it actually works.” [1] [2]"	prototype	"Integration Prototypes strive to address the three main ways in which prototypes can be valuable to designers.

Intervention/Provocation	"Description: The designer places 2D graphic visualisations or 3D objects within an environment to stimulate discussion and elicit a response from the user. These designed elements take the form of interventions or provocations within the research process, engaging a person’s imagination and encouraging a fuller response in ways that more formal interview and questionnaire techniques cannot achieve. Interventions can include futuristic prototypes that express new ideas; provocations can include shock imagery or incongruous juxtapositions.

Purpose: Greater engagement by the user and better understanding of their motivation

Context: Earlier stages of the design process – exploration and focus"		"Best suited to:
 Exploring subjects that could be sensitive- such as bathing or sexual health

Interviews	"Description: 
* One-on-one interviews provide information about individual actions and motivations that cannot be obtained in group discussions

Purpose: Deeper insight into people’s needs and perspectives

Context: Early to mid stages of the design process.

"	"Process:
* An interview is a conversation between a researcher and a respondent selected according to agreed criteria.
o It typically lasts an hour or two and may take place in any agreed setting.
* Interviews are particularly suitable for discussing sensitive issues, product categories where over-claiming or under-claiming is known to be a problem, and cases where individuality is of prime importance."	"Benefits of the method: 
Perfect for discussing:[1]
Circumstances of unique applicability, especially those involving sensitive or personal topics
Product categories where over-claiming or under-claiming is known to be a problem
Cases where individuality is of prime importance
Preferred to focus groups where people would be swayed by other participants' beliefs and conversation

Deficits of the method: 
Success depends on the interviewer's level of interpersonal skills

Individual depth interviews are more difficult to interpret, due to the sequential nature of data gathering masking an overview of consensus

Issue Cards	"The issue cards are a physical instrument used as a peg to induce and feed interactive dynamics inside a team.Each card could contain an insight, a picture, a drawing or a description; everything is able to suggest new interpretations of the problem and to induce the assumption of a different point of view. The result is the identification of new criticalities and opportunities in the context of reference.

Lateral Thinking	"Description: Designers and users are involved in a series of shared mental activities to provoke new ideas. 

Purpose: A range of ideas and early-stage concepts


Context: Early stages of the design process"	A useful starting point for this method is to list the sequence of actions in a particular process	 then play around with these by removing	 reversing or distorting some of them to provoke lateral thinking. Concepts that are generated may be sketched or written by either the designer or user.	"Best suited to: Generating a broad range of concepts for further development
Building empathy with users
Tackling a problem in new ways if thinking is stagnating

Layored Elaboration	"It enables design groups to add ideas presented by others with layers of transparencies while encouraging design team members to expand on those earlier ideas

Context: This technique is useful when non-destructive design annotation, limited space, and evolutionary artifacts are design requirements.This method should be used to brainstorm design ideas. "	"Guidelines: 
-Intergenerational design team consists of adults and children ages 7-11
-Adult reads a description of the current storyboard and then asks for how it can be improved
-Co-designers take turns talking and adding new ideas to the transparency
-Once the group thinks the storyboard is complete, the transparency is removed and a new group follows the same approach to give their ideas
"	"Benefits of the method:
Able to revisit design ideas and contribute new ones to make the design better
Able to contribute new ideas without destroying the original design idea by using transparencies
Portability
Allows many design members to include their inputs in a relatively short period of time
Low cost

Deficits of the method: 
-Confusion and less elaboration of design ideas, as some members do not pay attention to other groups as they debrief about their ideas
-Have to use permanent markers, as using washable markers causes smudges

Lead user	"Lead users are used for getting a great deal of insight from a user how has a heave personal investment in this field. They can very advantageous in the beginning of a design process as they often have a developed understanding of the breadth of the field as well as specifics. The use of lead users is also based on the idea that ""the future exists in the present.""  Lead users will often know the future direction of the product or field before it happens, or they may have desires in the field that have not been met yet, which can thus become the next step in the field."	"1. Find your lead users. -This may be done by advertising a large audience that there is an opening for a consumer consultant with a passionate interest in a given product.  In this fashion, the lead user will self select themselves as having an active, passionate, knowledge and insight of this field.

2. Learn from them - Use interviews, focus groups, diaries, or scenarios to gain insight on what they know"	"Benefit of the method: 
Lead users will help design researchers get immediately to a deeper level of understanding from some of the most knowledgeable individuals in the field. These users will have allready amassed a large amount of experience with the area of interest and will most likely be able to identify multiple specific improvements that can be made. Essentially, they may have already thought of the next step.

Longitudinal analysis	"Longitudinal Analysis invovles following individuals throughout their life rather than simply analyzing groups of people with the same age groups. 

Context: This is useful in the beginning of the design process when trying to understand users' biographies and how the advent of various technologies/products have affected their lifestyles throughout different time periods in their life."	"Recently, this process has been expedited by ""life-logging,"" which describes the the act of recording one's daily activities in the form of pictures, audio and video recordings, status updates on social networking websites, etc. [2] With the advent of cell phones that have third-party applications, Bluetooth, GPS, and built-in video cameras, this process is becoming universal."	"Benefit of the method: Analyzing longitudinally provides very thorough information regarding the physical and mental development of users and allows for more rigorous analysis of how technology has affected a user's environment and lifestyle. Furthermore, with the advent of mobile social networking applications, data from logs can be analyzed to reveal connections between strangers that weren't as easily perceivable before

Deficit of the method:
Analyzing individuals for long periods of time is often unpractical and very tedious. Therefore, generally analyzing several groups of people by age-group is more efficient for short time design processes. Regardless, several ethical disputes have arisen from Longitudinal Analysis in the form of lifelogging because privacy is invaded, and even the stored data, no matter how secure, is not very difficult to access.

* Identifies the groups that is most worth pursuing for a company
* Used to strengthen brand identity

Context: Market segmentation is usually done after the product has been designed. It is used in the marketing stage to figure out who are the potential target markets for the product."	"Guidelines:
Gather relevant data
       -meaningful segmentation depends on the patterns of
        consumers' actual buying behavior, therefore, it is

Mobile Probes	" To record users' particular environments in context as they move throughout their day. Mobile probes will gain particular insight of context as it records current feelings and interactions of the user because the mobile probes should be recorded in the moment and on the spot

Context: Mobile Probes should be used to before concept development so that the researchers are able to find out the users needs first."	"1. Compile the mobile probe: Mobile probes can consist of a few different features of both analogue and digital. Diaries, phone/pager, camera attachment. software to organize data and answers received.

2. ESM Experience Sampling Method: at intervals throughout the day text your subject a few short props via the cellular device. These could include questions to be responded to in notebook or in a txt reply. other prompts should ask the subject to take pictures of their environment so that researchers can interprate more from the scene. these pictures can also be used later to insight responses in an interview.

3. Projective Tools: these tools are used to find the associations, hopes and dreams, and feelings that a subject has in an area. Interviews are often used in conjunction with collages."

Mockup	The mock up is a model	 an illustration or a collage describing an idea.	"At the beginning of the design process, the mock up is mainly made through the use of photomontages, created with photos of existing situations, products or services combined with other elements.

During the next phases the mock up get more and more realistic, till they become real prototypes representing the main features of the project."

Multi-jet modeling	"“Also known as Thermojet, is a quick rapid prototyping process used for concept modeling. The system generates wax-like plastics models which are less accurate than stereolithography.” 

Context: Design stage of prototype
"	This process begins with a print head of jets arranged in a linear array. Each individual jet dispenses thermopolymer material on demand. The print head speeds back in forth like a line printer	 building layer upon layer of material that solidifies into the physical prototype. The part is built on a moveable platform that lowers after each layer is built.	"Benefit of the method: 
Ability to use thermoplastics.
No geometrical restrictions.
Very fine details with high resolution.
Excellent surface quality.
Very short production times.
Greater complexity does not increase cost.

Mystery Shopper	"Mystery shopping a way of auditing services through the involvement of trained user volunteers. Mystery shoppers have been described as 'under-cover' service users.
A Mystery Shopping exercise is conducted using volunteers who are trained and pose as service users in typical interactions with staff. The mystery shoppers then record their experience. By compiling the results from multiple mystery shopper sessions you can get a clearer idea of how service users experience a particular service. "	The task or scenario that the mystery shoppers will be working under needs to be elaborated and well developed so that the shoppers feel comfortable in their role. Following the visit the mystery shopper completes forms recording their experience. These are then gathered and collated. In some cases a follow up event is held with all mystery shoppers to explore common experiences.	"Benefit of the method: 
 Powerful way of gathering service user perspective

Deficit of the method:
• Limited to assessing services, cannot advise on what needs to change
• Short-term involvement

Naturalistic Group Interview	"* Naturalistic group interview is an interview technique that allows the researcher to collect information from naturally occurring conversations stemming from the fact that the people chosen for the group interviews all have a previous social relationship with each other.  Group influence tends to be ubiquitous in Asian countries, and it is therefore important to take this group dynamic into account in order to fully understand consumer behavior in this context


Purpose:  Goal of naturalistic group interviewing is to collect empirical data in the natural setting in which a consumption activity normally takes place.


Context: It is appropriate to use this quantitative analytic method at the beginning of the research process, when one is trying to find out consumer beliefs about something.
This method is appropriate for cultures that consider it taboo for people to disclose their thoughts and opinions, or where attitudes and beliefs tend to be formed at the group rather than the individual level.
"	"Process:
-Important to create an interview context that is conducive to consumers feeling comfortable and speaking freely in the way they would do in their everyday lives

-Gather consumers in natural groups and provide a context where they can engage in conversations that are similar to the type they would have when in their everyday lives

-Four people in a group interview is large enough to generate interaction and discussion, and is small enough for everyone to feel comfortable"	"Benefit of the methods: 
Can overcome many of the obstacles of cultures being unwilling to share individual beliefs and result in insightful data

Scenarios are a good way for consumers to express their implicit knowledge and judgments about a brand, and are a good way to overcome social desirability bias in Asian settings.

Empirical data gathered is more naturally occurring compared to focus groups because the participants have a social relation with each other prior to the interview

Deficits of the method:
Can lead to quick belief convergence due to the group being familiar with one another

Netnography	Netnography (Internet + Ethnography) is an online marketing research technique for providing consumer insight. It is used because it considered to be much faster	 simpler	 and less expensive than traditional ethnography. It also has the advantage of being more naturalistic and unobtrusive	 since you are learning about user behavior via the internet.	"1.    Researchers must have specific marketing research questions and then identify particular online forums appropriate to the types of questions that are of interest to them.
2.    They must learn as much as possible about the forums the groups and the individual participants they seek to understand.
3. Collect data - This includes: data that the researcher directly copies from the computer-mediated communications of online community members, and data that the researcher inscribes. Reflective fieldnotes, in which ethnographers record their observations, are a time-tested and recommended method in netnography.
4. Providing trustworthy interpretation - Marketing researchers must be conscious that they are analyzing the content of an online community's communicative acts rather than the complete set of observed acts of consumers in a particular community.
5. Consider Ethics - A) Are online forums to be considered a private or a public site? and B) What constitutes ""informed consent"" in cyberspace?
6. Member Checks - Some or all of a final research report's findings are presented to the people who have been studied in order to solicit their comments."	"Related Methods:

New Product Development Process	New product development research is very spotty and is still a relatively unrefined practice of research. Product creation is the core process supporting customer satisfaction and long-term growth in company value	 yet there is very little documentation on best practices of doing so. Researching new product development and implementation requires longitudinal research designs because of the length of time that the process typically takes will span anywhere from weeks to years.	 The majority of NPD research is based on either large questionnaires or qualitative anecdotal evidence	 which results in general conclusions without implementable managerial recommendations. Also	 very often research relies on the anecdotes of single key informants who may not be close enough to the work to give an informed overview.	"Benefit of the method: 
Fixing the current issues with new product development research will lead to richer and more interesting results and contributes to bridging the gap between NPD research and actual practices.

Deficit of the method: 
The majority of NPD research fails to account for the high amount of internal and external cooperation between different departments and parts of the development chain. Instead it continues to rely strongly on the use of single key informants to provide a complete picture of a group’s NPD efforts, instead of integrating multiple perspectives.
There is a lack of implementable research because of a discontinuity between the groups doing the research and the companies that would benefit from actually implementing the insights from the research.
The optimal way of implementing NPD research may be cost and time inefficient.

Object Brainstorm	Because objects suggest stories about how they might be used	 they make a great starting point for free association and exploration. 	"Process: Select objects that do things. After forming a collection of objects with the participants, start with the question ""How will the next generation os [fill-in-the-blank] work?"" Participants will play with the objects and take notes on the qwualities/attributes of objct. Then as a group decide which object the group wants to focus on. "	One choice to make before the process is whether to use a set ofnitems or a single item. This changes the depth of the focus. 	pg 109-Gamestorming	Gathering information																							
Observation and Shadowing	"Designers carefully observe real-life situations for a set amount of time to understand how people behave within a given context. This method can help to uncover the reality of what people really do – as opposed to what they say they do. 

Purpose: Insights and information on how people behave

Context: Earlier stages of the design process"	Shadowing an individual on a journey or activity can be used to identify opportunities for design and quickly understand a particular design context. Generally	 there are three types of observation: natural (covert) – no interference from the investigator	 controlled (overt) – the designer sets a task and observes it being carried out	 and participatory – the designer actively joins in the activity being observed to gain a firsthand perspective.	"Best suited to: Forming an opinion quickly on a particular topic at the early stage of a design project or testing a hypothesis

Observational methods for Service Marketing	"Observational methods for Service Marketing are data gathering techniques that focus on service experiences

Context: Observational methods for service marketing should be used to assess the service quality of an organization or interaction."	"Three dimensions that characterize how observation is conducted
1. Mode
    What are the observations made by?
2. Directness
    Is the service observation noted during or after the  
    event?
3. Concealment
    Are subjects aware that they are being observed?"	"Benefit of the method:
Complement more traditional methods of data collection
Serve as a means of discovery or hypothesis testing
Offer an ""up-close"" view of phenomena
Provide Information about phenomena that are gleaned in their natural setting[1]
A good method to examine service quality

Offering Map	The aim of an offering map is to describe in a synthetic way what the service offers to its users.	"There is not a standard format for this tool: the offering could be described by words or could be illustrated by images, but most frequently it is visualized through a graph.
This instrument could support the elaboration of the service idea as well the development of some specific solutions, it could be a tool for the implementation of the concept but also for the communication of the service to the final user. In each one of these situations, the offering map will assume different configurations and languages with reference to the specific aims and receivers involved."

Online Consultations	"
Online consultations utilise the internet to ask a group of people their opinion on an issue (typically a policy in the development stages). An unlimited number of participants can be sent information about the subject or download it online and respond via email or comment on the website.

Online consultation enables participants to comment in detail and those commissioning the process to collate responses and present the results back to participants quickly, comprehensively and transparently. The fact that the participant comments do not need to be transcribed adds real benefit and speeds up analysis.

Context: You should use an online consultation when:
• There is a clear and achievable aim
• Dealing with a large and/or widely dispersed group of participants
• Participants are more comfortable participating online than in other ways
 "	"Online consultations can take different forms. At its simplest consultation documents can be made available online together with an email address to send responses to.
 
 
Online consultation using structured templates is more complex and uses software that is designed to emulate the face-to-face methods used in facilitated workshops. Different templates can be used, for example, to allow participants to brainstorm ideas, identify issues, prioritise solutions, or comment on consultation documents.
 
Caution: Online Consultation should be avoided if your primary aim is to build strong, lasting relationships. It cannot deliver intensive deliberation, empowered participants, direct decisions or strong relationships between participants."	"Benefit of the method: 
• Allows a large number of people to contribute
• Gives all participants an 'equal voice'
• Can reach people who are unlikely to respond to traditional engagement methods
• A quick and accessible mode of engagement from the participants' perspective
• Allows participants to discuss an issue at their convenience (regardless of location or time)
• Anonymity of online processes can encourage open discussion
• Allows information gathering and giving without the constraints that group size or travel can place on face to face events

Deficit of the method: 
 Excludes people who do not or cannot access/navigate the internet
• If not carefully planned, online consultations can generate unmanageable amounts of material.
• The technology can shape the process rather than vice-versa.
• Written communication can be a barrier for some already marginalised groups.
• Any perceived complexity, such as registration, can be a barrier to participation.

Open Space	"Open Space Technology is often referred to as ""Open Space"". It is a meeting framework that allows unlimited numbers of participants to form their own discussions around a central theme.
Open Space events have a central theme, around which participants identify issues for which they are willing to take responsibility for running a session. At the same time, these topics are distributed among available rooms and timeslots. "	Open Space Technology was created in the mid-1980s by organisational consultant Harrison Owen when he discovered that people attending his conferences showed more energy and creativity during the coffee breaks than the formal sessions. Open Space is structured in a way that recreates this informal and open atmosphere combined with a clear sense of purpose.	"Benefit of the method:
• Accommodates for large and diverse groups
• Unleashes creativity
• Participant driven approach
• Extremely flexible process
• Builds better working relationships and a sense of community

The fundamental principles of Open Space are:
• Whenever it starts is the right time: Open Space encourages creativity both during and between formal sessions.
• When it's over it's over: Getting the work done is more important than adhering to rigid schedules.
• Whatever happens, happens: Let go of your expectations and pay full attention to what is happening in the moment.
• There is one ""Law"", the ""Law of two feet"": If participants find themselves in a situation where they are not learning or contributing they have a responsibility to go to another session, or take a break for personal reflection.

Open User Innovation	The ongoing  shift of innovation to users has some very attractive qualities. It is becoming progressively easier for many users to get precisely what they want by designing it for themselves. Innovation by users also provides a very necessary complement to and feedstock for manufacturer innovation. 	The open innovation paradigm can be interpreted to go beyond just utilizing external sources of innovation such as customers	 rival companies	 and academic institutions	 and can be as much a change in the use	 management	 and employment of intellectual property as it is in the technical and research driven generation of intellectual property. In this sense	 it is understood as the systematic encouragement and exploration of a wide range of internal and external sources for innovative opportunities	 the integration of this exploration with firm capabilities and resources	 and the exploitation of these opportunities through multiple channels	Innovation user and innovation manufacturer are the two general “functional” relationships between innovator and innovation. Users are unique in that they alone benefit directly from innovations.	http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/open_user_innovation.html	Generating ideas/concepts
