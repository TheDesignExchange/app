FedEx and Conifer approached this product development using Co-Creation. The Conifer team acted as facilitators and mediators between a group of FedEx customers and the development team. They visited shipping sites and talked to and observed shipping clerks, logistics managers, quality assurance directors, and everyone in between, gaining insight into customersâ€™ day-to-day operations and communication methods."},

The ability of national governments to effectively scale-up their ART treatment programs relies on the recommendations, guidelines, and data produced by global stakeholders such as WHO, PEPFAR. National governments struggle to assimilate this knowledge effectively because of information fragmentation and limited analytical capacity."},
