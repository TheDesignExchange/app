FedEx and Conifer approached this product development using Co-Creation. The Conifer team acted as facilitators and mediators between a group of FedEx customers and the development team. They visited shipping sites and talked to and observed shipping clerks, logistics managers, quality assurance directors, and everyone in between, gaining insight into customersâ€™ day-to-day operations and communication methods."},
